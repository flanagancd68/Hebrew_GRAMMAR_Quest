```

Many Hebrew grammar courses and books treat learning God's Holy Language as if it were just another academic exercise.  Listen to a lecture, read a chapter, take a test, and you'll learn Hebrew. 

We wish it were that simple.  

Hebrew, the Holy Language Way, requires **active** participation.  

That's where our Holy Language Learning Philosophy comes in.

## Our Learning Philosophy = ACTIVE Engagement {-}

Learning Hebrew the Holy Language Way is designed not just to feed you fish, but to teach you to fish<small>^[<small>Refer to Hebrew Quest, lesson 1.</small>]</small>.  When someone feeds you fish, you are only passively receiving.  When you learn to fish you are being active; being intentional.

In other words, we believe you will learn best when you actively (and dare we say "passionately") ***engage*** with the Holy Scriptures.  If done this way, learning Hebrew will not merely be another academic course you take, but it can be a life-changing experience. 

With Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, Holy Language Institute is offering yet another way for you to actively embrace the Jewishness of our faith. 

## Relationship to Hebrew Quest {-}

***Hebrew Quest*** took you directly *to* the Hebrew Scriptures and brought you in touch with the Hebraic side of the Bible that, perhaps, you had never experienced before.  We introduced you to a different aspect of what you may have known as "the Old Testament."  Maybe before Hebrew Quest, you had kept this "Old Testament" at a safe distance (after all, it was old and you are new!); but now you may have a new appreciation and perhaps you are building a closer friendship with what you now know as the "Tanach" or the "Hebrew Scriptures."

***Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest*** is designed to take you to the next stage of that friendship.  It is designed to take you *inside* the Hebrew Scriptures. Maybe it's like progressing from a "good friend" to an "intimate" friend. A friend for whom you are there during the good and the bad . . . and that friend is there for you offering you wisdom and counsel.  

Such a friendship can be challenging, and even difficult at times<small>^[<small>see Philippians 2:12</small>]</small>, but it can also be one of the most rewarding relationships you can have this side of heaven.

Whether or not you have finished (or even started) Hebrew Quest, we believe you will find Hebrew GRAMMAR quest a fruitful and life-changing experience. See [Appendix Q&A](#difference) for a larger discussion on how Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest work together.

## Three Stages of Preparation {-}

According to Dr. Wayne Stiles, to get the most out of a tour to Israel, one must actively prepare.  In fact, there are three stages of preparation Stiles says a traveler must undertake to gain maximum benefit from a Holy Land tour<small>^[<small>Stiles, Wayne. “How to Prepare for a Holy Land Tour.” Wayne Stiles. February 20, 2013. https://waynestiles.com/how-to-prepare-for-a-holy-land-tour/. Accessed September 28, 2020.</small>]</small>

1. Practical Preparation
2. Physical Preparation
3. Spiritual Preparation

### We believe these exact principles apply to learning Hebrew the Holy Language way! {-}

Read on for an explanation.

## _Practical_ Preparation: The lay of the Hebrew Grammar land {-}

Before the big trip to Israel, you need to know some basics.  

* You need some basic Holy Land Geography 
    * You need some basics as to what happened where
    * This way, you won't be completely lost when you arrive at a specific site, say Capernaum or Mount Carmel
    * You need to know why that place has meaning and is worth your time 
<!-- * Even more practical, you need to know electrical and cultural differences -->
<!--     * Since we all have electronics that need to be recharged, you also need to know what type of electrical current and outlets are used in Israel -->
<!--         * You better bring the right adapter or your camera won't have the power to capture all of those amazing memories -->
<!--     * There are also some cultural differences, such as a more formal dress code for "holy sites" than we might be used to at home -->
<!--         * You need to know the dress code so you don't look out of place (or worse, are refused admission)   -->
    
You might call this "getting the lay of the land".  

**Primarily, what this book consists of, is giving you the lay of the Hebrew Grammar land**.       



<!-- | Israel      | Grammar | -->
<!-- | :-----------: | :-----------: | -->
<!-- |Overview of Geography | Overview of Grammar | -->
<!-- | Different Electrical Outlets      | ![image](images/seghol_tsere.png)  Don't use a seghol-shaped plug in a tsere-shaped outlet!   | -->
<!-- | Modest Dress   | ![image](images/Qamets.png) If the rules say you need to be covered with a Qamets, don't show up wearing nothing but a pathach!<small>^[<small>These are vowels we will study in Lesson 2]  | -->


In our application, we will give you "Seven Practical Points."  These are the most significant things you will need to know about the lesson. 

Most importantly, our goal is to keep this discussion at a high-level. This means, where other textbooks might spend time explaining concepts to you in great detail, we will not.  Our goal is to give you just enough to pique your interest and get you pointed in the right direction.

We believe that you will learn best not from reading it in a book or watching a video, but you will learn best by putting concepts into practice.  

This is where _physical preparation_ comes in. But first, let's talk for a minute about safety . . . your "syntactical safety!"

## _Practical_ Preparation: Equipment Check {-}

Each lesson of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest builds upon the previous one. 

At the beginning of each chapter, you will see an Israeli stop sign with a few questions.

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}

include_graphics("images/stopil.png")
```

Use this as an opportunity to check whether you are familiar enough with the major concepts (and memorization where needed) from the previous lesson before you move on with your journey.

We call this "Equipment Check."  

Here, we leave the decision to proceed with your quest up to you.  Be honest with yourself.  If you are unsure about any area, we strongly encourage you to return to Anki for some more review. 

## _Physical_ Preparation: Get Hebrew healthy with Anki Aerobics {-}

Israel is a rocky, hilly place. Many of the best sites require some walking, or even a small hike from the parking lot.  Those who hope to passively see the country from a bus window but who could have done more had they done some exercising beforehand, are going to miss out on the best parts. For maximum benefit, travelers must be ready for a lot of walking. 

Most of your class time will be spent not in reading this book or watching lectures. In Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, your **TRUE** learning will take place during what we call "ACTIVities."   

In fact, we'd like this book to be like be your personal trainer.  A trainer shows you how to do your workout safely and effectively.  She gives you some "practical" pointers and then turns it over to you to do the actual lifting.  In our case, your brain will be doing the lifting instead of your biceps.

* The majority of your learning time will be spent in a free flashcard program called Anki.  Please see [About Anki](#Anki) for additional information on Anki if you are not familiar with it.
    * **Anki** is the equivalent of your gym and cardio equipment for Hebrew Health
    * Just like working out is not easy and you don’t always see quick results, don’t expect Anki to be easy or expect to breeze through it
    * Just like physical exercise, if you stick with it, you will see the rewards over time
* In addition to Anki, some lessons will have worksheets to reinforce concepts

## _Physical_ Preparation: Combat "the fog" (aka grammar jet lag) {-}


For most of us, Israel is close to halfway around the globe away from home.  After such a long flight, we are unlikely to completely avoid jet lag, but we can take steps to minimize the effects and work through it as quickly as possible.

<!-- | Israel      | Grammar | -->
<!-- | ----------- | ----------- | -->
<!-- | Get in shape      | ![image](images/anki.png) Anki software - Gym equipment for your brain!   | -->
<!-- | Prepare for Jet Lag   | ![image](images/fog.jpg)<small>^[<small>By Ilias81 - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1651258] "The Fog"   | -->


Jet lag is similar to a phenomenon we can encounter when we undertake a study of a new language. Dr. Bill Mounce calls "the fog.'

* Many times, things won’t make sense until a lesson or two later
* A strategy suggested by Dr. Mounce is to "look back at your previous victories to assure you of your progress"<small>^[<small>https://medium.com/@ellingburg/surviving-the-fog-dcb3f148ffa1</small>]</small>
* In addition to a steady flow of new material, Anki has an algorhithm to deliver structured reviews.  These reviews will help you keep working through your grammar jet lag

* Periodically, there will be **Quest Quizzes** in the online course
    * Periodic checkpoints for you to assess your progress
        * _Are you OK to continue?_
        * _Do you need to review some more before going on?_ 
            * If you do, that's perfectly ok 
            * It's all part of working through "the fog".
    * The quizzes are scored for your assessment, but no grades are "recorded" -  
    * In fact, no grades are given for the course.


## _Spiritual_ Preparation {-}

### Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is a spiritual journey! {-}

A trip to Israel is not like any other "vacation" - it's a spiritual journey. If all you do see some cool sites and take some pictures, you would have missed out on a tremendous opportunity to meet Yeshua in His special Land.


*Pray and be open to what Yeshua may be teaching you*

We will be reading a lot of Scripture!

* Ruth Pursuits - learning grammar concepts while learning Ruth 1
* Anki Study Verses - you will read and begin to translate passages in Anki
    * You'll also listen to the audio by Izzy so you can begin to hear the sound of the language

View each ACTIVity as an act of worship!

## What will a typical lesson look like? {-}

1. **Practical Preparation** - Seven key learning objectives from each lesson

2. **Physical Preparation**
    1. Anki Aerobics - This is where your primary vocabulary and grammar learning will occur
    2. Worksheets - opportunities for additional reinforcement (selected lessons only)
    3. Quest Quiz - This is your opportunity for a learning check to help you battle through the fog

3. **Spiritual Preparation** - 
    1. Ruth Pursuit - a quest activity where you will identify grammar concepts in Ruth chapter 1 
    2. Anki Study Verses - Verse comprehension and translation
