## Navigating this book {- #navigating}

In the upper-left corner of this page, you will see a series of icons.  

```{r, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/toolbar.png")
``` 

These do the following tasks:

* the file drawer expands/collapses the sidebar table of contents; you can also click `s`
* the magnifying glass toggles search input; you can also click `f`
* the big `A` allows you to change the font size and theme
* the little `i` shows you available keyboard shortcuts


There are several ways to navigate from page to page within this guidebook:

* Use the left-navigation sidebar (type `s` to reveal/hide)
* Click the left or right arrow on each page to go forward or back
* Use the left or right arrow keys on your keyboard to move forward or back
* Use hyperlinks on selected pages, like this one: [Continue to the Introduction section](#motivation)


Along the way, you'll see some informational boxes.  Here is what they mean:

::: {.infobox .map}
QUEST   

* The Lesson Itinerary - learning objectives
* Ruth Pursuit, Hebrew Quest Study Passages, and other "Quest" related topics
:::

::: {.infobox .stop}
STOP  

* Equipment Check - concepts from previous lessons you should know before starting the next lesson
* Other "Dont's"
:::

::: {.infobox .light}
LIGHT  

* A critical point not to be missed
* Other "Do's"
* You will often want to MEMORIZE the concepts in a LIGHT box
:::

::: {.infobox .info}
INFO  

Additional information that is good to know
:::

::: {.infobox .caution}
CAUTION  

A potential pitfall, such as a concept that could be easily confused with another

We also have footnotes<small>^[<small>Minor or parenthetical/non-essential points will be included as footnotes throughout each lesson.</small>]</small>


## Quick Start Instructions {.unnumbered #get_started}

These instructions will get you up and running with the course.  

> **Anki NOTE**: Eventually, you can do all work from a mobile device.  _For the initial Anki install, you do need to do these steps from a desktop or laptop_.  The Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Anki deck can only be imported into the desktop Anki application.

## A Typical Lesson {- #typical-lesson}

```{r, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/checklist.png")
```

In this course, you won't just read; you will DO!  This course is going to be jam-packed with activities. Below is what will be inside a typical lesson<small>^[<small>We are following the same chapter organization as the textbook <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u>, while extensively leveraging supplemental materials created by Dr. John Beckman, which he has generously made available for free to the Hebrew learning community.  See the [Course Structure](#what_to_expect) and our [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments) pages for additional information.</small>]</small>:


**Title**|**Description**|**Estimated Time**
:-----|:----- | :---
  READING|
Lesson Itinerary | The lesson's key learning objectives | <1
Equipment Check|Things you must have in your backpack before proceeding with the next phase of your journey | <1
First Thought |A Bible verse from the lesson in Hebrew, audio from Izzy, and a brief devotional | 5
Lesson Points | The main grammar concepts - Our goal is to give you just enough information to get started in `Anki`.  You can easily identify the Lesson Points as they will be the numbered sections in each lesson. 1.1, 1.2, etc. | 15-45
 ACTIVITIES|
 `Word and Verse Warm-ups`|Starting with Lesson 3, these are brief "stretching" exercises before doing the `Anki` workouts, narrated by Izzy! | 5-10
 `Anki`<small>^[<small>See [appendix](#anki_faq) for more information on Anki if you are not familiar with it.</small>]</small>| This is where the majority of your learning will take place.  There will be three stages to each Lesson. | 60-180 total (Anki is meant to do a little each day as driven by the software's algorithm)
`A. Vocab`|By the end of the course, you will have around 500 Hebrew words memorized
 `B. Grammar`|Here, you will work through (and at times grapple with) the main grammar concepts discussed in the Lesson.
 `C. Workbook`| Brief Hebrew word activities to reinforce the grammar concepts.  In Unit 3, the focus shifts to what is called "parsing" of verbs.  Verb parsing means identifying the root, stem, person, gender, number, and meaning of a verb.
 `D. Study Verses`| You will begin to translate from Hebrew to English. This component may not be easy at first but stick with it!  Although these verses are similar to the _Hebrew Quest_ Memrise modules, our goal for the `Study Verses` is translation and comprehension, not rote memorization.
`Worksheets`|Additional activities to reinforce learning (selected lessons) | 30-45
`Ruth Pursuit`|Similar to the "bag the letter" in _Hebrew Quest_. You will identify examples of grammar concepts in Ruth Chapter 1 | 15-60
`Quest Quiz`|Self-assessment activity to measure your familiarity with the material for YOU to assess whether you are ready to advance in your quest to the next lesson.  No grades are recorded or granted in this course. There are no quizzes after Lesson 11. | 15-30
`Twelve Tribes Badges`, Unit Completion `Certificates`, and `Graduation`| Fun things to mark and celebrate the completion of various stages of your GRAMMAR Quest | 3-5
TOTAL |Depending on how fast you work:|2.5-6 hours per Lesson

Of course, some lessons will be more involved than others, and each of us works at different paces. One of the beautiful things about a self-paced class is the pace is not set by a course syllabus.  The pace is set by YOU!

::: {.box .light}
DON'T BE OVERWHELMED!  YOU GOT THIS!

Use the `Course Checklist` to help keep you organized and do a little bit at a time. Instructions for accessing this were back on the Quick Start page. If you haven't already downloaded it, you can get it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t0C7JlygyUqgF_aQWbhq7h3s_VDn0VuvISJn5mp-LdE/copy){target="_blank"} 
:::

Also, for those seeking additional translation practice and exposure to the Hebrew Bible, we have an OPTIONAL _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage Track beginning with Lesson 13.  You will read through the passage, compose a translation, then watch (or re-watch) the _Hebrew Quest_ video where Izzy walks us through the passage.  There is more information on this in the Unit 3 introduction.

## Report an Issue {- #report_issue}

Please do not hesitate to report any errors, omissions, or improvement opportunities.  In fact, we'd rather hear about mistakes sooner rather than later! Feedback is anonymous.  

::: {.box .stop}
If you have a specific question about the content or are stuck on a concept, please use the [Get Help](#get_help) question form instead of the `Report an Issue` form.

## Ask a question {- #get_help}

While this is a self-paced course with no formal instructor or teaching assistant, we want to provide a way for you to get help and ask a question should you get stuck.

We request that before you submit a question, you read through the lesson a couple of times, then attempt to do the Anki cards for that lesson.  Sometimes by doing this, things will "click" on their own.  If you are still unclear, we are here!

Use the form below to ask a question. Please note, we are staffed by volunteers, so please allow a few days for us to research and get back to you.
