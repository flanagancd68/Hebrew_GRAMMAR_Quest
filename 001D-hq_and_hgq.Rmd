What do we mean by "Hebrew Quest: Extended Edition"?  

Suppose you were to take a hypothetical microscope and inspect Lessons 13-15 of _Hebrew Quest_. In that case, we believe <u>Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest</u> is what you would see. Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will begin with a brief review of the Aleph-bet and the vowels we learned in _Hebrew Quest_ Lessons 1-12. Then we begin our deep dive into grammar topics touched upon in _Hebrew Quest_ Lessons 13-15.

If you finished _Hebrew Quest_, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest might be a logical next step.  

On the other hand, maybe you started _Hebrew Quest_ but hit some roadblocks.  In that case, we believe Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest can provide you with important underlying grammatical concepts so, eventually, you can return to _Hebrew Quest_ and finish up.  We're going to help you with this goal. In the second half of this grammar course, we will incorporate several of the [Study Passage](https://holylanguage.com/ot-readings.html) sections of _Hebrew Quest_.  

If you have an interest in learning some of the inner workings of Hebrew, then we'd say you're in the right place!
