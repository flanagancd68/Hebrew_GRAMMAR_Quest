In keeping with our philosophy that active learning is better than passive learning, we refer to our activities as `ACTIVities`.  You'll recognize an ACTIVity in this book by `this special font`.

Here is what will be inside a typical lesson:

1. `Lesson Prayer` before each lesson
1. `Equipment Check` from the previous lesson
1. Seven Practical Points - the lesson's key learning objectives
2. `Worksheets` (selected lessons only)
1. `Word and Verse Warm-ups` (starting with Lesson 3)
1. `Anki Aerobics`
    1. `A. Vocab`
    1. `B. Grammar`
    2. `C. Study Verses`
1. `Ruth Pursuit`
3. `Hebrew Quest Study Passages` (starting with Lesson 18)
3. `Quest Quiz` 

Additionally, there will be `Twelve Tribes Badges` and `Graduation` after selected lessons as encouragement

So you can see, this course is going to be jam-packed with things to do. 

When you encounter an ACTIVity, remember that it's all part of showing you how to fish instead of just our telling you about fishing!
