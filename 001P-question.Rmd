# Get Help {- #get_help}

While this is a self-paced course with no formal instructor or teaching assistant, we do want to provide a way for you to get help if you get stuck.

We request that before you submit a question, you read through the lesson's Seven Points a couple of times, then attempt to do the Anki cards for that lesson.  If you are still unclear, we are here!

Use the form below to ask a question. Please note, we are staffed by volunteers, so please allow a few days for us to research and get back to you.  If you have general feedback or wish to report an issue, please use the [Report an Issue](#report_issue) form.
