# Motivation for building this course {- #motivation}

If you are familiar with our ministry, you know our flagship course ***Hebrew Quest***, which introduces our students to the Jewishness of our Messiah and of our Bible.

***Hebrew Quest*** was designed to get students into the Hebrew text as quickly as possible, with minimal focus on learning rules. For many of our students, this approach is quite successful. 

We noticed other students began to drop off between lessons 12 and 16<small>^[<small>These are the "bridge" lessons in between the Aleph-Bet (1-11) and the study passages (17-40), where Hebrew grammar concepts were introduced.]</small>. The feedback we received was many students were getting "stuck" on grammar concepts.

As we searched for external Biblical Hebrew grammar resources to recommend to our students, we noticed that they tended to fall into one of two camps:

1. <u>A workbook or a series of videos that are completely self-paced/self-directed</u>. 
    * There may be a some exercises, but in general, tend to not be rigorous from an academic standpoint.
    * Additionally, with this format there is no way for a student to get feedback on progress.
    
2. <u>Academic/Seminary level textbooks and courses</u>. 
    * These materials are __extremely__ rigorous with copious amounts of reading, rote memorization of paradigms, lectures, and exams
    * The textbooks generally are much more detailed than most of our students need (or would enjoy).
    * The pace of these courses is usually fast and the stress level is high, with a large focus on due dates and grades.

Additionally, materials from both categories would have required significant additional fees from our students.

## What WE wanted in a course {-}

---

Although many of the resources we researched are top-notch, here is what ***we*** wanted to see in our ideal Hebrew grammar course:

* In terms of rigor, the course would necessarily be easy (maybe partway between the self-paced workbooks and an academic course), but it would enjoyable with a low-stress level.
* The course would be self-paced for independent learning, but provide feedback and encouragement
* The course must align with our [Holy Language Learning Philosophy](https://holylanguage.com/learning-philosophy.php): emphazise active forms of learning more than tons of reading and long lectures (which are passive learning components)
* From a technological standpoint, the course simple and inexpensive to deliver, and maintain, but also high-quality and visually pleasant.
* It would be easy (and free, if possible) for our students to use.
* Most importantly, the course would be Yeshua-centered that approaches learning Hebrew as a spiritual as well as academic endeavor

We couldn't find a course like this...so we BUILT it ourselves!
