## Why is Holy Language offering a Hebrew grammar course? {- #motivation}

If you are familiar with our ministry, you know our flagship course ***Hebrew Quest***, which introduces our students to Yeshua and our Jewish Bible.

***Hebrew Quest*** was designed to get students into the Hebrew text as quickly as possible, with minimal focus on learning rules. For many of our students, this approach is quite successful.  We noticed that many other students started to drop off between lessons 12 and 16, after the Aleph-Bet lectures. For some students, these lessons were too much Hebrew grammar too fast, and for others, it was not enough Hebrew grammar.  

As a result, several of our students have asked us for a grammar resource to supplement _Hebrew Quest_.  

As we searched for a resource to recommend to these students, we noticed that they tended to fall into one of two camps:

1. <u>A workbook or a series of videos that are entirely self-paced/self-directed</u> 
2. <u>Academic/Seminary level textbooks and courses</u>

These two are often opposite extremes.  Self-paced courses can have too little structure and often provide only a superficial review of Hebrew.  In the end, the student may only be slightly more prepared to read the Hebrew Bible than if they had not done the course.  There are also limited feedback opportunities as these courses are designed for independent learning.  On the other hand, seminary courses and seminary-level textbooks are usually incredibly rigorous with copious amounts of reading, rote memorization of paradigms, lectures, and exams. Academic courses are fast-paced and high-stress ^[For example, in a seminary course, the 36 lessons in <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> are usually completed in 16 weeks.]. Seminary textbooks generally are much more detailed and advanced than most of our students need (or would enjoy)^[For example, there is usually an emphasis on writing Hebrew and conducting English-to-Hebrew translations.  While these may be important skills to become fluent in Hebrew, one does not need these skills to read and understand the Bible, especially from a spiritual or devotional perspective.]
   
Additionally, with either option, our Holy Language students would incur additional fees to purchase these materials.  Many of the resources we researched are top-notch.  Depending on a student's goals, we would not hesitate to recommend them.  It's just that they were not quite what we were seeking for the majority of our students.

See the next section to learn how Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is distinct.

## How is Hebrew GRAMMER Quest distinct? {- #our_course}

Our Holy Language goals for a Hebrew grammar course are the following:

* Academically CHALLENGING, but with a LOW-STRESS level
* Primary emphasis on READING and UNDERSTANDING God's Word
    * We use grammar rules, paradigms, and memorization as a means to achieve this goal
    * The "final exam" should be whether you can understand the Bible, not whether you can conjugate a a particular Hebrew verb
    * We do not prioritize writing or speaking in Hebrew^[We believe this course, in conjunction with **Hebrew Quest**, would prepare a pastor or lay-teacher of a small-group, or traditional Christian or Messianic congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text in order to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience.  Even so, we are not presenting this as a substitute for seminary-level Hebrew for those who are seeking (or whose vocational position requires) more of a formal instructional approach. With all this said, the more of THIS course and _Hebrew Quest_ you complete, the more rewarding THAT course will be!. In any case, ***our prayer is that this course, along with Hebrew Quest, will give new life to Hebrew application in that person's teaching ministry***.  This book's compiler can testify to this!]
    * We are not addressing Modern Hebrew
* Self-paced for independent learning but with mechanisms to provide FEEDBACK, ENCOURAGEMENT, and ways to CELEBRATE Students' ACCOMPLISHMENTS in the course
* Aligns with our [Holy Language LEARNING PHILOSOPHY](https://holylanguage.com/learning-philosophy.php): emphasize active forms of learning over copious amounts of textbook reading and long lectures
* COMPLIMENTS and INTEGRATES WITH _Hebrew Quest_, but does not replace it; Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is not a substitute for completing _Hebrew Quest_
* SUSTAINABLE from a technical standpoint, meaning the course is inexpensive and straightforward for the ministry to develop, deliver, and maintain
* FREE of charge for our students
* Most importantly, the course must be YESHUA-CENTERED that approaches learning Hebrew grammar as a spiritual as well as an academic endeavor (which is also a big part of our Learning Philosophy)

We are essentially trying to take the best attributes of a self-paced course and merge them with the best characteristics of a seminary-level Hebrew course!  The result in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest!

### Holy Language Learning Philosophy {-}

We have talked a bit about our Holy Language Learning Philosophy.  Our belief is you learn best by doing.  Izzy discusses this in greater detail in the clip below from **Hebrew Quest** Lesson 1.  As a reminder, you can increase the speed of YouTube videos by clicking "Settings", then adjusting the "Playback Speed" to your liking.

## What is the Relationship to _Hebrew Quest_? {- #hgq_and_hq}

We've said that Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest does not replace _Hebrew Quest_.  Instead, we believe Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest supports and extends _Hebrew Quest_.  In fact, one way to think of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest could be as "Hebrew Quest: Extended Edition"!  

Suppose you were to take a hypothetical microscope and inspect Lessons 13-15 of _Hebrew Quest_. These are the lessons where Izzy reviews Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, and other grammar topics.  Under that microscope, <u>Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest</u> is what you would see. 

```{r, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center'}

``` 

* Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will start with a brief review of the Aleph-bet and the vowels we learned in _Hebrew Quest_ Lessons 1-12
* Then we begin our deep dive into core grammar topics touched upon in _Hebrew Quest_ Lessons 13-15
* Additionally, starting with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Lesson 12, students can elect to complete a "_Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage Track"
    * Primary geared for students who have not yet completed all of _Hebrew Quest_, this will incorporate the Proverbs study and the Bible reading sections from _Hebrew Quest_
    * Students will read through the passage and compose a translation
    * They will then watch Izzy's _Hebrew Quest_ teaching video explaining the passage
    * Students who complete all of the _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage Tracks will receive extra special recognition upon completion of the course.  It our way of saying you have graduated "with honors"!

## Is completion of _Hebrew Quest_ is a prerequisite? {- #finish_hq}

Emphatically NO!

If you _have_ finished _Hebrew Quest_, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest might be a logical next step to go deeper.

On the other hand, maybe you started _Hebrew Quest_ but hit some roadblocks.  In that case, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest can provide you with important underlying grammatical concepts so, eventually, you can return to _Hebrew Quest_ and finish up. 

It's important to know that Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is an _extension_ of Hebrew Quest, not a substitute.  

As a best-case, we recommend you complete _Hebrew Quest_ Lessons 1-12 before starting Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.  So, if you haven't started either course, go ahead and start with the first part of _Hebrew Quest_.  _Hebrew Quest_ [videos are here](https://holylanguage.com/quest.html){target="_blank"}, and the accompanying [Memrise module is here](https://app.memrise.com/course/5406435/hebrew-quest-lessons-1-to-40/){target="_blank"}.

To say it differently, _Hebrew Quest_ and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest complement one another in a circular (and maybe slightly paradoxical!) form:

* The more _Hebrew Quest_ you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, and . . .
* The more Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of _Hebrew Quest_ (especially _Hebrew Quest_ Lessons 13-40)
* Either way, you can't go wrong!  The most important thing is to start and ultimately complete both.  Again, the _Hebrew Quest_ study passage track within Hebrew Grammar Quest will get you on your way to this lofty goal of completing both courses.
