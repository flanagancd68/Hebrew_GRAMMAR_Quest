You may be tempted to skip over this section so you can get right into Lesson 1.  RESIST this urge!

* If you were going on a strenuous hike, at some point you would have to make sure you had the right shoes!
* Consider this section as your trip to the store to get the right equipment _before_ you begin your quest!

The Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Guidebook is where you will get _introduced_ to the material.  Anki (along with the other activities) is where you will ___LEARN___ the material

* As you work through this course, set aside time to review Anki on a DAILY basis
  * If one wants to build strength and endurance, it's essential to use the right machines
  * Anki is a free^[All platforms are free, except for the iOS app, which costs $25. The developers use the proceeds to fund future development.  Most reviews say the cost is worth it if you have Apple devices and use Anki regularly.] flashcard application that helps you build both Hebrew strength and Hebrew endurance!

The table below shows the steps necessary to get properly fitted before you begin your quest.  They should take about 10 or 15 minutes depending on your internet speed.  Please do these steps from a desktop computer (not a mobile device) for best results.

::: {.box .caution}
Failure to follow these steps could lead to Anki frustration!

These settings will optimize your Anki experience.  

The Windows platform is shown, but Mac/Linux/mobile settings are very similar.

[YouTube video showing these steps](https://youtu.be/4fwPZUEOKuY){target="_blank"}
:::

1. Change `USER1` Name to your name
    1. In Anki, click `File`, then `Switch Profile`  
    2. Select `User 1`, then `Rename` and type your name
2. To change learning settings, click the gear button next to "Hebrew Grammar Quest", then click `Options`
```{r, out.width = "250pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Anki Deck Options"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.anki_options.png")
```
3. Make sure your settings match the images below:

### Daily limits and New Cards {-}

```{r, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Daily Limits and New Cards"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.ankisettings01.png")
```

Notes^[NEW CARDS/DAY: You are welcome to enter any number you wish, but lower numbers mean it will take longer to get through the entire deck.  `200` is recommended, but this does not mean you have to do 200 new cards in one day or the next day you will have 400 new cards.  You will never have more new cards than the number entered here. INSERTION ORDER: If you find `Sequential` is too easy, you might try to switch to `Random`.]


### Lapses and Timer {-}

Note^[`Show answer timer` is optional.]

```{r, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Lapses and Timer"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.ankisettings02.png")
```


### Burying and Audio {-}

```{r, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Burying and Audio"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.ankisettings03.png")
```


Notes^[Cards that have multiple answers are called `siblings`.  Turning the sibling settings on is more challenging; leaving these off is less challenging.  We recommend to start with these turned on.]

### Advanced {-}
 
```{r, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Advanced"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.ankisettings04.png")
```

Anki Add-ons

* Anki has a number of `Add-ons` for the desktop platforms you might find interesting.
* You might check out [Advanced Review Bottom Bar](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1136455830)
  * Or `Tools` / `Addons` / `Get Add-ons` / then enter `1136455830`
  * You can tweak the add-on settings in the `ARBb` menu - try `Button style` = `Wide + Background Color`
* Another useful add-on is [More Overview Stats](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/738807903)
  * This displays your `Young` vs `Mature` cards on the deck's dashboard - see picture ^[1st column is number of cards.  2nd column is percentage of cards.  3rd column is percentage of cards excluding `Suspended` cards (for the `Unit Certificate` your screenshot must reflect 0 suspended cards).]
  * Add-on number: `738807903`
