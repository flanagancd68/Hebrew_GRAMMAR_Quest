If one wants to build strength and endurance, it's essential to use the right machines.  Anki is a free^[All platforms are free, except for the iOS app, which costs $25. The developers use the proceeds to fund future development.  Most reviews say the cost is worth it if you have Apple devices and use Anki regularly.] flashcard application that helps you build both Hebrew strength and Hebrew endurance!

| :-- | :-- | :--
|1. Get Google Account [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&hl=en&dsh=S-1425209384%3A1610207553422339&gmb=exp&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp){target="_blank"} | You will need a Google account to complete many of the activities in this course.  Alternatively, you may wish to create an additional account exclusively for this course. Creating a Google account is free. | [YouTube: Step 1](./images/00.googlesignup.png){target="_blank"}
|2. Download the [course checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t0C7JlygyUqgF_aQWbhq7h3s_VDn0VuvISJn5mp-LdE/copy){target="_blank"} to your personal Google Drive Folder | This is for you to keep track of your progress in this course. Be sure to update it as you complete each lesson, which will help you stay on track to earn `Badges`, Unit completion `Certificates`, and ultimately, `Graduation`! | [YouTube: Step 2](./images/00.HGQChecklist.png){target="_blank"}
3.  Download and install the [free Ezra SIL font](https://software.sil.org/downloads/r/ezra/EzraSIL-2.51.zip ){target="_blank"} | This enables Hebrew font in Anki cards. After downloading, extract the zip file to a location of your choice. Then double-click on `SILEOT.ttf`, which should give you the option to install the font. | [YouTube: Step 3](./images/00.ezrasilfolder.png){target="_blank"}
4. [Sign up for a free Ankiweb account here](https://ankiweb.net/account/register){target="_blank"} | This allows you to backup and sync your data to the cloud and mobile devices | [YouTube: Step 4](./images/00.ankisignup.png){target="_blank"}
5. [Download and Install the Anki Program (Mac/PC/Linux)](https://apps.ankiweb.net/){target="_blank"} | Click the `Download` button, then select the tab with your operating system^[The version numbers will change with the passage of time.  Unless instructed otherwise, download the curent version of the Anki desktop program on their website].  Despite the fact that you will see an `iPhone/Android` tab, you MUST install Anki from a desktop/laptop first | [YouTube: Step 5](./images/00.ankiinstall.png){target="_blank"}
6. Download the Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Anki Decks | These decks are the backbone of the course.  Research shows using a tool like `Anki` is far more effective than reading or exams alone.  Note: You can download all decks now or, you may wish to start with just `Unit 1`.  Then you can load the remaining decks as you begin each new Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest unit.  We will have reminders in each unit introduction. After downloading, double-click to load into Anki - _you must do this from a desktop/laptop, not a mobile device_ | [YouTube: Step 6](https://youtu.be/)

| [Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Unit 4 Anki Deck (version 0.1)](./images/HGQ_Anki_Unit4_V00.apkg){target="_blank"} |
7. Change the Anki settings (see next section) | `Anki` is driven by an algorithm that we can customize for maximum effectiveness | [YouTube: Step 7](https://youtu.be/)
8.  Sync to Ankiweb - in Anki, click on `Sync` (enter Ankiweb credentials) - `upload to Ankiweb` if asked. | Syncing creates a version of your deck in the cloud, which case be used to sync with a mobile device or merely as a backup | [YouTube: Step 8](https://youtu.be/)
9. As desired, download the Anki app to your phone or tablet: [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki){target="_blank"} or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4){target="_blank"} | While the Android version is free, the iOS version has a one-time fee of $25. Apple users might consider using the [web version](https://ankiweb.net/account/login){target="_blank"} for the first few lessons while you assess whether the cost is justified
10. To use an `Anki` _mobile_ app, click on `Sync` and click `download from Ankiweb` | Should you go back and forth between mobile and desktop, make sure you `Sync` each time and be careful when you select `upload to` or `download from` to make sure your information is flowing in the correct direction
 
::: {.box .stop}
**Anki NOTE**: Eventually, you can do all work from a mobile device.  _For the initial Anki install, you do need to do these steps from a desktop or laptop_.  The Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Anki deck can only be imported into the desktop Anki application.

| Step | Comments
| :-- | :-- 
1. Change `USER1` Name | 1. In Anki, click `File`, then `Switch Profile`  
| |    2. Select `User 1`, then `Rename` and type your name
2. Change global settings  |  1. Click `Tools,` then `Preferences.` 
| | 2. On the `Scheduling` tab, check the box that says `Anki 2.1 Scheduler`.
Change card learning options | 1. On the main page, click the gear wheel to the right of “Hebrew Grammar Quest” and select `Options` ([click to see example](./images/a.anki_settings.png){target="_blank"})
|`New Cards`^[ See https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/deck-options?id=new-cards for additional information and the definitions of these terms, `New`, `Review`, and `Lapsed`] | `Steps` = 10 1440 4320
| |`New cards/day` = 200
| |`Graduating interval` = 15
| | `Easy interval` = 60
| |`Starting ease` = 250%
| |`Bury related new cards...` = we recommend CHECKED, but this is not mandatory^[Checking this means that cards with two or more questions won't be presented on the same day.  The risk of leaving it unchecked is that you may get Question #2 correct not because you know the answer, but because you just saw the answer when you reviewed Question #1.  Checking the box means you will not see Question #2 on the same day as Question #1.  Thus, checking the box will increase the length of time required to move cards from `Young` to `Mature`, but is the stronger option for learning.]
| `Reviews` | `Maximum reviews/day` = 9999
| | `Easy bonus` = 130%
| |`Interval modifier` = 100
| | `Maximum interval` = 210
| | `Bury related reviews...` = we recommend CHECKED, but this is not mandatory   
| `Lapses` | `Steps` = 10
| | `New interval` = 60
| | `Maximum interval` = 1
| | `Leech threshold` = 8
| | `Leech action` = TAG ONLY

After changing, your settings should look like this:

## How do I navigate within Anki? {-}

::: {.box .map}  
* We have also created a brief tutorial within our Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest `Anki` deck for Unit 1.  
* This is contained in the `0.Introduction` folder.  
* Click on this deck for an introduction and helpful hints
* When you are finished you may `Suspend` the cards (these are the only cards in the deck you should `suspend`!)

:::

* Click the +/- buttons to expand/collapse the folders within the Anki deck [(click to see example)](./images/00.ankifolders.png){target="_blank"}
    * To start with Lesson 01 Vocabulary, click on the plus buttons within Unit 1, until you see `Lesson 01 Vocabulary` and click the `STUDY NOW` button
    * In your initial learning, start with the `module` level, i.e. `Lesson 01 Vocabulary`
    * Once you have learned all cards in all modules, REVIEW at the Lesson level, e.g. `Lesson 01`
    * Once you have learned all cards in all Lessons in a unit, then REVIEW at the Unit level, e.g. `1. Lessons 1-3`
* Many cards have "hints" - click on the `hint` button to reveal [(click to see example)](./images/a.anki_hint.gif){target="_blank"}
    * If you needed a hint, be sure to select `Again` on the answer side
* When you are ready to see the answer, click Spacebar, Enter, or the `Show Answer` button

## How do I know when to hit the `Good` button on an Anki card? {-}

We suggest using the following guidelines:

* `Again`
  * Your answer was incorrect, or a mixture of correct and incorrect on a multi-part answer
  * Your answer was correct, but you required a hint
* `Hard` - You otherwise met the requirements for `Good`, but you struggled to produce the correct answer or guessed. 
* `Good`
  * All parts of the answer are correct; no hints
  * For Bible Verses, mark `Good` when:
    * you can read and understand the verse in Hebrew
    * Your translation is roughly similar to the English answer, even if you need to take a few moments to work through the verse
    * Your verb tense is correct (even though we won't study verbs until Unit 3)
    * You do NOT need to have the passage and its meaning memorized to mark `Good`
  * Be patient and honest with yourself.  If you are unsure between `Again` and `Good,` then select `Again.`
* `Easy`
  * We do not recommend selecting `Easy.` 
  * An exception might be when you are confident that you already have the word, rule, or passage memorized


::: {.box .info}
Be patient with yourself.  It may take you _many_ tries in the early going before you can hit `Good.`

<!-- Introduction: -->
<!-- front: I want to test English to Hebrew. How can I set the deck to do this? -->
<!-- back: Our primary goal with Hebrew Grammar Quest is to translate from Hebrew to English.   -->

<!-- Most of our students studying Biblical Hebrew are not going to need to translate from English to Hebrew, although that is certainly a worthy pursuit.   -->


<!-- If you would like to add a reverse direction to your vocabularly words (Prompt with English - Answer with Hebrew) this is can be done in Anki. We have added "Note Types" to accomodate this. -->

<!-- Click "Browse" -->
<!-- From the Left Navigation, scroll down to "Vocab Basic Hebrew" -->
<!-- Select the card(s) you wish to change and add the additional options (To change ALL cards click CTRL+A to select all cards) -->
<!-- Click CTRL+SHIFT+M to change the note type to one of the following: -->
<!-- If you want to be tested on both Hebrew-to-English and reverse, English-to-Hebrew, select note type "Vocab Basic Hebrew/English" -->
<!-- If you have added images and want to be tested on Hebrew-to-English, English-to-Hebrew, and Image-to-Hebrew, select note type "Vocab Basic Hebrew/English/Image" -->
<!-- If you have added images and only want to be tested on Hebrew-to-English and Image-to-Hebrew, select note type "Vocab Basic Hebrew/Image" -->
<!-- Just be aware that changing to one of these optional note types, will literally double (or triple if you chose Hebrew/English/Image) the number of vocabularly cards.  If you decide you want to go back to just Hebrew-to-English, repeat steps 1-4 and select Note Type "Vocab Basic Hebrew." -->
