* The Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Guidebook is where you will get introduced to the material
* Anki (along with the other activities) is where you will LEARN the material
* This section will get you up and running with Anki and will get your Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest headed in the right direction
:::

::: {.box .stop}
* You may be tempted to skip over this section so you can get right into Lesson 1.  RESIST this urge!
* If you were going on a strenuous hike, at some point you would have to make sure you had the right shoes
  * Then you wouldn't want to wear those new shoes for the first time on your hike; you would want to break them in first (or your feet would not be very happy with you)
* Consider `Anki and Course Setup` as your trip to the store to get the right equipment then get comfortable with it _before_ you begin your quest!

If one wants to build strength and endurance, it's essential to use the right machines.  Anki is a free^[All platforms are free, except for the iOS app, which costs $25. The developers use the proceeds to fund future development.  Most reviews say the cost is worth it if you have Apple devices and use Anki regularly.] flashcard application that helps you build both Hebrew strength and Hebrew endurance!

We suggest using the following guidelines:

* `Again`
  * Your answer was incorrect, or a mixture of correct and incorrect on a multi-part answer
  * Your answer was correct, but you required a hint
* `Hard` - You otherwise met the requirements for `Good`, but you struggled to produce the correct answer or guessed. 
* `Good`
  * All parts of the answer are correct; no hints
  * For Bible Verses, mark `Good` when:
    * you can read and understand the verse in Hebrew
    * Your translation is roughly similar to the English answer, even if you need to take a few moments to work through the verse
    * Your verb tense is correct (even though we won't study verbs until Unit 3)
    * You do NOT need to have the passage and its meaning memorized to mark `Good`
  * Be patient and honest with yourself.  If you are unsure between `Again` and `Good,` then select `Again.`
* `Easy`
  * We do not recommend selecting `Easy.` 
  * An exception might be when you are confident that you already have the word, rule, or passage memorized


::: {.box .info}
Be patient with yourself.  It may take you _many_ tries in the early going before you can hit `Good.`

In this course, you won't just read; you will DO!  This course is going to be jam-packed with activities. Below is what a typical lesson will contain^[We are following the same chapter organization as the textbook <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u>, while extensively leveraging supplemental materials created by Dr. John Beckman, which he has generously made available for free to the Hebrew learning community.  See the [Course Structure](#what_to_expect) and our [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments) pages for additional information.]:

::: {.box .caution}
A general comment about the guidebook

* At times, you may feel like information is being shot at you from a firehose and nothing is sinking in
* Often, this is just how it is when learning a new language
* You may be absorbing more than you think you are
* This is why we emphasize reinforcement of these concepts through activities
    * Notice the root word "active" in activities
* You will get introduced to the material via the Lesson Points, but don't expect to learn everything on the first pass (or from simply reading alone) 
* You will LEARN the material through the activities
::: 

**Title**|**Description**|**Estimated Minutes**
:-----|:----- | :---
  READING | 
Lesson Itinerary | Introduction and the lesson's learning objectives | <1
Equipment Check|Things you must have in your backpack before proceeding with the next phase of your journey | <1
First Thought |A Bible verse from the lesson in Hebrew, audio from Izzy, and a brief devotional | 5
Lesson Points | The main grammar concepts. Our goal is to give you just enough information to get started in `Anki`.  You can easily identify the Lesson Points as they will be the numbered sections in each lesson. 1.1, 1.2, etc. | 15-45
 ACTIVITIES|
 `Word and Verse Warm-ups`|Starting with Lesson 3, these are brief "stretching" exercises before doing the `Anki` workouts, narrated by Izzy! | 5-10
 `Anki`^[See [appendix](#anki_faq) for more information on Anki if you are not familiar with it.]| This is where the majority of your learning will take place.  There will be four modules to each Anki Lesson: `A. Vocab`, `B. Grammar`, `C. Workbook/Parsing`, and `D. Study Verses` | 60-180 total (Anki is meant to do a little each day as driven by the software's algorithm)
`A. Vocab`|By the end of the course, you will have around 500 Hebrew words memorized
 `B. Grammar`|Here, you will work through the main grammar concepts discussed in the lesson.
 `C. Workbook/Parsing`| Brief Hebrew word activities to reinforce the grammar concepts.  In Unit 3, the focus shifts to what is called "parsing" of verbs.  Verb parsing means identifying the root, stem, person, gender, number, and meaning of a verb.
 `D. Study Verses`| You will begin to translate from Hebrew to English. This component may not be easy at first but stick with it!  Although these verses are similar to the _Hebrew Quest_ Memrise modules, our goal for the `Study Verses` is translation and comprehension, not rote memorization.
`Worksheets`|Additional activities to reinforce learning (selected lessons) | 30-45
`Ruth Pursuit`|Similar to the "bag the letter" activity in the early lessons of  _Hebrew Quest_. You will identify examples of grammar concepts in Ruth Chapter 1 | 15-60
`Quest Quiz`|Self-assessment activity to measure your familiarity with the material for YOU to assess whether you are ready to advance in your quest to the next lesson.  No grades are recorded or granted in this course. There are no quizzes after Lesson 11. | 15-30
`Twelve Tribes Badges`, Unit Completion `Certificates`, and `Graduation`| Fun things to mark and celebrate the completion of various stages of your GRAMMAR Quest | 3-5
TOTAL |Depending on how fast you work:|2.5-6 hours per Lesson

Of course, some lessons will be more involved than others, and each of us works at a different pace. One of the beautiful things about a self-paced class is the speed and due dates are not set by a course syllabus.   With a self-paced class, YOU are in control!

Also, for those seeking additional translation practice and exposure to the Hebrew Bible, we have an OPTIONAL "Honors Track", _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passages."  These will begin with Lesson 12.  You will read through the passage, compose a translation, then watch (or re-watch) the _Hebrew Quest_ video where Izzy walks us through the passage.  There is more information on this in the Unit 3 introduction.

Lastly, you might be encouraged by this article on [conquering the Fog](./images/00_Fog_Article.pdf){target="_blank"}.  The "Fog" is a term coined by Dr. Bill Mounce, author of _Basics of Biblical Greek_.  "Fog" describes the feeling that you aren't making any progress in learning a Biblical language when you actually are making TREMENDOUS progress!

<!-- deleted anki cards: -->
<!-- Introduction: -->
<!-- front: I want to test English to Hebrew. How can I set the deck to do this? -->
<!-- back: Our primary goal with Hebrew Grammar Quest is to translate from Hebrew to English.   -->

<!-- Most of our students studying Biblical Hebrew are not going to need to translate from English to Hebrew, although that is certainly a worthy pursuit.   -->


<!-- If you would like to add a reverse direction to your vocabularly words (Prompt with English - Answer with Hebrew) this is can be done in Anki. We have added "Note Types" to accomodate this. -->

<!-- Click "Browse" -->
<!-- From the Left Navigation, scroll down to "Vocab Basic Hebrew" -->
<!-- Select the card(s) you wish to change and add the additional options (To change ALL cards click CTRL+A to select all cards) -->
<!-- Click CTRL+SHIFT+M to change the note type to one of the following: -->
<!-- If you want to be tested on both Hebrew-to-English and reverse, English-to-Hebrew, select note type "Vocab Basic Hebrew/English" -->
<!-- If you have added images and want to be tested on Hebrew-to-English, English-to-Hebrew, and Image-to-Hebrew, select note type "Vocab Basic Hebrew/English/Image" -->
<!-- If you have added images and only want to be tested on Hebrew-to-English and Image-to-Hebrew, select note type "Vocab Basic Hebrew/Image" -->
<!-- Just be aware that changing to one of these optional note types, will literally double (or triple if you chose Hebrew/English/Image) the number of vocabularly cards.  If you decide you want to go back to just Hebrew-to-English, repeat steps 1-4 and select Note Type "Vocab Basic Hebrew." -->
