As we begin,  we wanted to let you know our purposes for our course, and what, we believe, makes our course distinct from the many other Hebrew learning options available.

Our Holy Language goals for a Hebrew grammar course are the following:

* Academically CHALLENGING, but with a LOW-STRESS level
* Primary emphasis on READING and UNDERSTANDING God's Word
    * We approach learning Hebrew from a _devotional_ level, more than an academic one
    * We use grammar rules, paradigms, and memorization as a means to achieve this goal
    * The "final exam" should be whether you can understand the Bible, not whether you can conjugate a a particular Hebrew verb
    * We do not prioritize writing or speaking in Hebrew^[We believe this course, in conjunction with **Hebrew Quest**, would prepare a pastor or lay-teacher of a small-group, or traditional Christian or Messianic congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text in order to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience.  Even so, we are not presenting this as a substitute for seminary-level Hebrew for those who are seeking (or whose vocational position requires) more of a formal instructional approach. With all this said, the more of THIS course and _Hebrew Quest_ you complete, the more rewarding THAT course will be!. In any case, ***our prayer is that this course, along with Hebrew Quest, will give new life to Hebrew application in that person's teaching ministry***.  This book's compiler can testify to this!]
    * We are not addressing Modern Hebrew
* Self-paced for independent learning but with mechanisms to provide FEEDBACK, ENCOURAGEMENT, and ways to CELEBRATE Students' ACCOMPLISHMENTS in the course
* Aligns with our [Holy Language LEARNING PHILOSOPHY](https://holylanguage.com/learning-philosophy.php): emphasize active forms of learning over copious amounts of textbook reading and long lectures
    * This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the material, but only about 20% of learning (if that) comes from a passive activity such as reading.  This is why we have added audio narration to help with retention.
    * The activities such as Anki, is truly where you will LEARN the material - note the root word ACTIVE in the word "activities"
* COMPLIMENTS and INTEGRATES WITH _Hebrew Quest_, but does not replace it; **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is not a substitute for completing _Hebrew Quest_**
    * See the Appendix FAQs for additional discussion on how _Hebrew Quest_ and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest relate to one another
* SUSTAINABLE from a technical standpoint, meaning the course is inexpensive and straightforward for the ministry to develop, deliver, and maintain
* FREE of charge for our students
* Most importantly, the course must be YESHUA-CENTERED that approaches learning Hebrew grammar as a spiritual as well as an academic endeavor (which is also a big part of our Learning Philosophy)

We are essentially trying to take the best attributes of a self-paced course and merge them with the best characteristics of a seminary-level Hebrew course, all in a way that reflects the heart of the Holy Language Institute!  We believe that result is Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest!

* As we noted previously, the Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Guidebook is where you will get _introduced_ to the material
* Anki (along with the other activities) is where you will __LEARN__ the material
* If one wants to build strength and endurance, it's essential to use the right machines.  Anki is a free^[All platforms are free, except for the iOS app, which costs $25. The developers use the proceeds to fund future development.  Most reviews say the cost is worth it if you have Apple devices and use Anki regularly.] flashcard application that helps you build both Hebrew strength and Hebrew endurance!
* As you work through this course, set aside time to review Anki on a DAILY basis

The table below shows the steps necessary to get properly fitted before you begin your quest.  They should take about 10 or 15 minutes depending on your internet speed.  Please do these steps from a desktop computer (not a mobile device) for best results.

These settings will optimize your Anki experience.  

The Windows platform is shown, but Mac/Linux/mobile settings are very similar.

[YouTube video showing these steps](https://youtu.be/4fwPZUEOKuY){target="_blank"}
:::

1. Change `USER1` Name to your name
    1. In Anki, click `File`, then `Switch Profile`  
    2. Select `User 1`, then `Rename` and type your name
2. To change learning settings, click the gear button next to "Hebrew Grammar Quest", then click `Options`
```{r, out.width = "250pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Anki Deck Options"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.anki_options.png")
```
3. Make sure your settings match the images below:

### Daily limits and New Cards {-}

```{r, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Daily Limits and New Cards"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.ankisettings01.png")
```

Notes^[NEW CARDS/DAY: You are welcome to enter any number you wish, but lower numbers mean it will take longer to get through the entire deck.  `200` is recommended, but this does not mean you have to do 200 new cards in one day or the next day you will have 400 new cards.  You will never have more new cards than the number entered here. INSERTION ORDER: If you find `Sequential` is too easy, you might try to switch to `Random`.]


### Lapses and Timer {-}

Note^[`Show answer timer` is optional.]

```{r, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Lapses and Timer"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.ankisettings02.png")

### Burying and Audio {-}

```{r, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Burying and Audio"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/00.ankisettings03.png")
```


Notes^[Cards that have multiple answers are called `siblings`.  Turning the sibling settings on is more challenging; leaving these off is less challenging.  We recommend to start with these turned on.]

Anki Add-ons

* Anki has a number of `Add-ons` for the desktop platforms you might find interesting.
* You might check out [Advanced Review Bottom Bar](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1136455830)
  * Or `Tools` / `Addons` / `Get Add-ons` / then enter `1136455830`
  * You can tweak the add-on settings in the `ARBb` menu - try `Button style` = `Wide + Background Color`
* Another useful add-on is [More Overview Stats](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/738807903)
  * This displays your `Young` vs `Mature` cards on the deck's dashboard - see picture ^[1st column is number of cards.  2nd column is percentage of cards.  3rd column is percentage of cards excluding `Suspended` cards (for the `Unit Certificate` your screenshot must reflect 0 suspended cards).]
  * Add-on number: `738807903`

## The Fog {-}

The "Fog" is a term coined by Dr. Bill Mounce, author of _Basics of Biblical Greek_.  "Fog" describes the feeling that you aren't making any progress in learning a Biblical language when you actually are making TREMENDOUS progress!


Mounce states, "The fog means you will have read a chapter and think you understand it—and perhaps you do—but it will seem foggy. That’s okay. If living in the fog becomes discouraging, look two chapters back and you should understand that chapter clearly. In two more chapters the presently foggy chapter will be clear, assuming you keep studying."

Here is an article on the subject you may find encouraging: [Conquering the Fog](./images/00_Fog_Article.pdf){target="_blank"}.  

::: {.box .light}
Keep pressing on!

* Review a chapter, do the activities, then try the Anki work
* If Anki is proving difficult, go back and review the chapter, or perhaps view the full-length Lecture or complete the additional worksheets provided by Dr. Beckman.  You can find a link to these in `Lesson Extras`
