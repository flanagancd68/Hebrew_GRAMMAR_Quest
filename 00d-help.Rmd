## Navigating this book {- #navigating}

In the upper-left corner of this page, you will see a series of icons.  

```{r, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/toolbar.png")
``` 

These do the following tasks:

* the file drawer expands/collapses the sidebar table of contents; you can also click `s`
* the magnifying glass toggles search input; you can also click `f`
* the big `A` allows you to change the font size and theme
* the little `i` shows you available keyboard shortcuts


There are several ways to navigate from page to page within this guidebook:

* Use the left-navigation sidebar (type `s` to reveal/hide)
* Click the left or right arrow on each page to go forward or back
* Use the left or right arrow keys on your keyboard to move forward or back
* Use hyperlinks on selected pages, like this one: [Continue to "A Typical Lesson" section](#features)



## A Typical Lesson {- #typical-lesson}

```{r, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/checklist.png")
```

In this course, you won't just read; you will DO!  This course is going to be jam-packed with activities. Below is what a typical lesson will contain:<small>^[<small>We are following the same chapter organization as the textbook <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u>, while extensively leveraging supplemental materials created by Dr. John Beckman, which he has generously made available for free to the Hebrew learning community.  See the [Course Structure](#what_to_expect) and our [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments) pages for additional information.</small>]</small>:


**Title**|**Description**|**Estimated Minutes**
:-----|:----- | :---
  READING|
Lesson Itinerary | Introduction and the lesson's learning objectives | <1
Equipment Check|Things you must have in your backpack before proceeding with the next phase of your journey | <1
First Thought |A Bible verse from the lesson in Hebrew, audio from Izzy, and a brief devotional | 5
Lesson Points | The main grammar concepts. Our goal is to give you just enough information to get started in `Anki`.  You can easily identify the Lesson Points as they will be the numbered sections in each lesson. 1.1, 1.2, etc. | 15-45
 ACTIVITIES|
 `Word and Verse Warm-ups`|Starting with Lesson 3, these are brief "stretching" exercises before doing the `Anki` workouts, narrated by Izzy! | 5-10
 `Anki`<small>^[<small>See [appendix](#anki_faq) for more information on Anki if you are not familiar with it.</small>]</small>| This is where the majority of your learning will take place.  There will be four stages to each Lesson: `A. Vocab`, `B. Grammar`, `C. Workbook/Parsing`, and `D. Study Verses` | 60-180 total (Anki is meant to do a little each day as driven by the software's algorithm)
`A. Vocab`|By the end of the course, you will have around 500 Hebrew words memorized
 `B. Grammar`|Here, you will work through the main grammar concepts discussed in the lesson.
 `C. Workbook/Parsing`| Brief Hebrew word activities to reinforce the grammar concepts.  In Unit 3, the focus shifts to what is called "parsing" of verbs.  Verb parsing means identifying the root, stem, person, gender, number, and meaning of a verb.
 `D. Study Verses`| You will begin to translate from Hebrew to English. This component may not be easy at first but stick with it!  Although these verses are similar to the _Hebrew Quest_ Memrise modules, our goal for the `Study Verses` is translation and comprehension, not rote memorization.
`Worksheets`|Additional activities to reinforce learning (selected lessons) | 30-45
`Ruth Pursuit`|Similar to the "bag the letter" activity in the early lessons of  _Hebrew Quest_. You will identify examples of grammar concepts in Ruth Chapter 1 | 15-60
`Quest Quiz`|Self-assessment activity to measure your familiarity with the material for YOU to assess whether you are ready to advance in your quest to the next lesson.  No grades are recorded or granted in this course. There are no quizzes after Lesson 11. | 15-30
`Twelve Tribes Badges`, Unit Completion `Certificates`, and `Graduation`| Fun things to mark and celebrate the completion of various stages of your GRAMMAR Quest | 3-5
TOTAL |Depending on how fast you work:|2.5-6 hours per Lesson

Of course, some lessons will be more involved than others, and each of us works at a different pace. One of the beautiful things about a self-paced class is the speed and due dates are not set by a course syllabus.   With a self-paced class, YOU are in control!

DON'T BE OVERWHELMED!  YOU GOT THIS!

Use the `Course Checklist` to help keep you organized and do a little bit at a time. Instructions for accessing this were back on the Quick Start page. If you haven't already downloaded it, you can get it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t0C7JlygyUqgF_aQWbhq7h3s_VDn0VuvISJn5mp-LdE/copy){target="_blank"} 
:::

Also, for those seeking additional translation practice and exposure to the Hebrew Bible, we have an OPTIONAL _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage Track beginning with Lesson 13.  You will read through the passage, compose a translation, then watch (or re-watch) the _Hebrew Quest_ video where Izzy walks us through the passage.  There is more information on this in the Unit 3 introduction.

Lastly, you might be encouraged by this article on [conquering the Fog](./images/00_Fog_Article.pdf){target="_blank}.  The "Fog" is a term coined by Dr. Bill Mounce, author of _Basics of Biblical Greek_.  "Fog" describes the feeling that you aren't making any progress in learning a Biblical language when you actually are making TREMENDOUS progress!

## Quick Start Instructions {.unnumbered #get_started}

These ten easy steps will get you up and running with the course.  

<!-- update the final anki deck version - current link is PREVIEW -->

| Step | Comments
| :-- | :-- 
|1. Get Google Account [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&hl=en&dsh=S-1425209384%3A1610207553422339&gmb=exp&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp){target="_blank"} | You will need a Google account to complete many of the activities in this course.  Alternatively, you may wish to create an additional account exclusively for this course
|2. Download the [course checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t0C7JlygyUqgF_aQWbhq7h3s_VDn0VuvISJn5mp-LdE/copy){target="_blank"} | This is for you to keep track of your progress in this course. Be sure to update it as you complete each lesson, which will help you stay on track to earn `Badges`, Unit completion `Certificates`, and ultimately, `Graduation`!
3.  Download and install the [free Ezra SIL font](https://software.sil.org/downloads/r/ezra/EzraSIL-2.51.zip ){target="_blank"} | This enables Hebrew font in Anki cards
4. [Sign up for a free Ankiweb account here](https://ankiweb.net/account/register){target="_blank"} | This allows you to backup and sync your data to the cloud and mobile devices
5. [Download and Install the Anki Program (Mac/PC/Linux)](https://apps.ankiweb.net/){target="_blank"} | You MUST install Anki from a desktop/laptop first
6. [Download the Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Anki Deck](./images/Hebrew Grammar Quest PREVIEW.apkg){target="_blank"} | This deck is the backbone of the course.  Research shows using a tool like `Anki` is far more effective than reading or exams alone
7. Change the Anki settings (see next section) | `Anki` is driven by an algorithm that we can customize for maximum effectiveness
8.  Sync to Ankiweb - in Anki, click on `Sync` (enter Ankiweb credentials) - `upload to Ankiweb` if asked. | Syncing creates a version of your deck in the cloud, which case be used to sync with a mobile device or merely as a backup
9. As desired, download the Anki app to your phone or tablet: [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki){target="_blank"} or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4){target="_blank"} | While the Android version is free, the iOS version has a one-time fee of $25. Apple users might consider using the [web version](https://ankiweb.net/account/login){target="_blank"} for the first few lessons while you assess whether the cost is justified
10. To use an `Anki` _mobile_ app, click on `Sync` and click `download from Ankiweb` | Should you go back and forth between mobile and desktop, make sure you `Sync` each time and be careful when you select `upload to` or `download from` to make sure your information is flowing in the correct direction
11. Finally, read the `Getting Started/Getting Help` and `About This Course` introductions | You have already started this! These sections contain essential background information to help assure you are oriented to Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.  If you are not familiar with `Anki`, the `Help with Anki` section (on the next page) is critically important to read.
    
> **Anki NOTE**: Eventually, you can do all work from a mobile device.  _For the initial Anki install, you do need to do these steps from a desktop or laptop_.  The Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Anki deck can only be imported into the desktop Anki application.

As you work through this course, set aside time to review Anki on a DAILY basis
:::

The sections below will help you get started with Anki. There is also an `0. Introduction` section within the Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Anki deck with additional how-to information.


### Customize Anki Settings {- #anki_settings}

1. Change `USER1` Name 
    1. In Anki, click `File`, then `Switch Profile`  
    2. Select `User 1`, then `Rename` and type your name
1. Change global settings
    1. Click `Tools,` then `Preferences.` On the `Scheduling` tab, check the box that says `Anki 2.1 Scheduler`.
1. On the main page, click the gear wheel to the right of “Hebrew Grammar Quest” and select `Options` ([click to see example](./images/a.anki_settings.png){target="_blank"})
    1. `New Cards`<small>^[<small> See https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/deck-options?id=new-cards for additional information and the definitions of these terms, `New`, `Review`, and `Lapsed`</small>]</small>
        * `Steps` = 10 1440 4320
        * `New cards/day` = 200
        * `Graduating interval` = 15
        * `Easy interval` = 60
        * `Starting ease` = 250%
        * `Bury related new cards...` = we recommend CHECKED, but this is not mandatory<small>^[<small>Checking this will _slightly_ increase the length of time required to move cards from `Young` to `Mature`, but is the stronger option for learning.</small>]</small>
    2. `Reviews`
        * `Maximum reviews/day` = 9999
        * `Easy bonus` = 130%
        * `Interval modifier` = 100
        * `Maximum interval` = 210

```{r, out.width = "700pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Settings"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/anki_custom_new.png")
```
    
### How do I navigate within Anki? {-}

* Click the +/- buttons to expand/collapse the folders within the Anki deck [(click to see example)](./images/a.anki_hint.gif){target="_blank"}
  * To start with Lesson 01 Vocabulary, expand to reveal this deck, click on `Lesson 01 Vocabulary` and click the `STUDY NOW` button
* Many cards have "hints" - click on the `hint` button to reveal [(click to see example)](./images/anki.png){target="_blank"}
    * If you needed a hint, be sure to select `Again` on the answer side
* When you are ready to see the answer, click Spacebar, Enter, or the `Show Answer` button

### How do I know when to hit the Good button on an Anki card? {-}

We suggest using the following guidelines:

* `Again`
  * Your answer was incorrect, or a mixture of correct and incorrect on a multi-part answer
  * Your answer was correct, but you required a hint
* `Good`
  * All parts of the answer are correct; no hints
  * For Bible Verses, you can read and understand the passage in Hebrew. Your translation is roughly similar to the English answer, even if you need to take a few moments to work through the verse. You do NOT need to have the passage and its meaning memorized to mark `Good`
  * Be patient and honest with yourself.  If you are unsure between `Again` and `Good,` then select `Again.`
* `Easy`
  * We do not recommend selecting `Easy.` 
  * An exception might be when you are confident that you already have the word, rule, or passage memorized
* `Hard` - You otherwise met the requirements for `Good`, but you struggled to produce the correct answer or guessed.  `Hard` may not be an option on cards in the learning phase.

::: {.box .info}
Be patient with yourself.  It may take you _many_ tries in the early going before you can hit `Good.`

What appears in the sections below is only the information you will need for Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.

We are here to [help](#report_issue) with any issues related to the course, including our `Hebrew Grammar Quest Anki Deck`.  Unfortunately it is beyond our scope to give you a complete tutorial _or offer any technical support with the Anki software or mobile app_.  We encourage you to check out the numerous articles and tutorial videos posted by the Anki community, which you can find from a simple web search.  The official Anki documentation is available [here](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/){target="_blank"}.

## Course Resources {- #optional_resources}

REQUIRED: 

* Other than being a subscriber to Holy Language Institute, you will not need to purchase or obtain anything for this course (unless you want to)
* You will need a computer with internet access, a free Google account to open and complete documents and exercises, the free Anki desktop software to do the flashcard activities, and a pen or a pencil to complete writing worksheets

OPTIONAL:

Below are additional resources, some of which are free and some paid:

* Free of charge
  * Thanks to his extremely generous reuse license, we have leveraged many of the worksheets and content from [Dr. John Beckman](https://hebrewsyntax.org/bbh2new/){target="_blank"}.  If you want more detail into any lesson, you may wish to refer to Dr. Beckman's videos and handouts.  Everything on his site is free.
  * Dr. Bill Mounce has study guides available for each Chapter of _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_
    * In most cases, these will not vary much from the lessons in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, but some students might find them valuable
    * For Chapter 1, click [http://hebrew.billmounce.com/BasicsBiblicalHebrew-01.pdf](http://hebrew.billmounce.com/BasicsBiblicalHebrew-01.pdf){target="_blank"); for other chapters, change the `01` in the URL to the chapter number you are seeking<small>^[</small>Except Chapter 4, which for some reason, is not available.</small>]</small>
* Paid
  * As mentioned elsewhere, Anki's iOS app requires a one-time purchase through the Apple store of $25.  If you have an iPhone, we believe this is a relatively inexpensive investment in your Hebrew journey.  
  * To supplement your studies, you may wish to purchase the _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_ textbook or any of the accompanying resources:
    * [Basics of Biblical Hebrew Textbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031053349X/&tag=holylanginst-20)
    * [Basics of Biblical Hebrew Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310533554/&tag=holylanginst-20)
    * [Basics of Biblical Hebrew Laminated Reference Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031026295X/&tag=holylanginst-20)
    * We would appreciate it if you would use one of the affiliate links, which allows Holy Language Institute to receive a small commission

## Ask a question {- #get_help}

While this is a self-paced course with no formal instructor or teaching assistant, we want to provide a way for you to get help and ask a question should you get stuck.

We request that before you submit a question, you read through the lesson a couple of times, then attempt to do the Anki cards for that lesson.  Sometimes by doing this, things will "click" on their own.  If you are still unclear, we are here!

Use the form below to ask a question. Please note, we are staffed by volunteers, so please allow a few days for us to research and get back to you.
