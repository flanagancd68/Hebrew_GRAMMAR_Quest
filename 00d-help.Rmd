In the upper-left corner of this page, you will see a series of icons.  

```{r, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/toolbar.png")
``` 

These do the following tasks:

* the file drawer expands/collapses the sidebar table of contents; you can also click `s`
* the magnifying glass toggles search input; you can also click `f`
* the big `A` allows you to change the font size and theme
* the little `i` shows you available keyboard shortcuts


There are several ways to navigate from page to page within this guidebook:

* Use the left-navigation sidebar (type `s` to reveal/hide)
* Click the left or right arrow on each page to go forward or back
* Use the left or right arrow keys on your keyboard to move forward or back
* Use hyperlinks on selected pages, like this one: [Continue to "A Typical Lesson" section](#features)

In this course, you won't just read; you will DO!  This course is going to be jam-packed with activities. Below is what a typical lesson will contain^[We are following the same chapter organization as the textbook <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u>, while extensively leveraging supplemental materials created by Dr. John Beckman, which he has generously made available for free to the Hebrew learning community.  See the [Course Structure](#what_to_expect) and our [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments) pages for additional information.]:


**Title**|**Description**|**Estimated Minutes**
:-----|:----- | :---
  READING| A general comment about the guidebook: at times, you may feel like information is being shot at you from a firehose.  Often, this is just how it is when learning a new language. The fact is that you may be absorbing more than you think you are.  This is why we emphasize reinforcement of these concepts through activities.  Notice the root word "active" in activities.  You will get introduced to the material via the Lesson Points, but you will LEARN the material through the activities.  
Lesson Itinerary | Introduction and the lesson's learning objectives | <1
Equipment Check|Things you must have in your backpack before proceeding with the next phase of your journey | <1
First Thought |A Bible verse from the lesson in Hebrew, audio from Izzy, and a brief devotional | 5
Lesson Points | The main grammar concepts. Our goal is to give you just enough information to get started in `Anki`.  You can easily identify the Lesson Points as they will be the numbered sections in each lesson. 1.1, 1.2, etc. | 15-45
 ACTIVITIES|
 `Word and Verse Warm-ups`|Starting with Lesson 3, these are brief "stretching" exercises before doing the `Anki` workouts, narrated by Izzy! | 5-10
 `Anki`^[See [appendix](#anki_faq) for more information on Anki if you are not familiar with it.]| This is where the majority of your learning will take place.  There will be four modules to each Anki Lesson: `A. Vocab`, `B. Grammar`, `C. Workbook/Parsing`, and `D. Study Verses` | 60-180 total (Anki is meant to do a little each day as driven by the software's algorithm)
`A. Vocab`|By the end of the course, you will have around 500 Hebrew words memorized
 `B. Grammar`|Here, you will work through the main grammar concepts discussed in the lesson.
 `C. Workbook/Parsing`| Brief Hebrew word activities to reinforce the grammar concepts.  In Unit 3, the focus shifts to what is called "parsing" of verbs.  Verb parsing means identifying the root, stem, person, gender, number, and meaning of a verb.
 `D. Study Verses`| You will begin to translate from Hebrew to English. This component may not be easy at first but stick with it!  Although these verses are similar to the _Hebrew Quest_ Memrise modules, our goal for the `Study Verses` is translation and comprehension, not rote memorization.
`Worksheets`|Additional activities to reinforce learning (selected lessons) | 30-45
`Ruth Pursuit`|Similar to the "bag the letter" activity in the early lessons of  _Hebrew Quest_. You will identify examples of grammar concepts in Ruth Chapter 1 | 15-60
`Quest Quiz`|Self-assessment activity to measure your familiarity with the material for YOU to assess whether you are ready to advance in your quest to the next lesson.  No grades are recorded or granted in this course. There are no quizzes after Lesson 11. | 15-30
`Twelve Tribes Badges`, Unit Completion `Certificates`, and `Graduation`| Fun things to mark and celebrate the completion of various stages of your GRAMMAR Quest | 3-5
TOTAL |Depending on how fast you work:|2.5-6 hours per Lesson

Of course, some lessons will be more involved than others, and each of us works at a different pace. One of the beautiful things about a self-paced class is the speed and due dates are not set by a course syllabus.   With a self-paced class, YOU are in control!

DON'T BE OVERWHELMED!  YOU GOT THIS!

Use the `Course Checklist` to help keep you organized and do a little bit at a time. Instructions for accessing this are on the Quick Start page. If you haven't already downloaded it, you can get it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t0C7JlygyUqgF_aQWbhq7h3s_VDn0VuvISJn5mp-LdE/copy){target="_blank"} 
:::

Also, for those seeking additional translation practice and exposure to the Hebrew Bible, we have an OPTIONAL _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage Track beginning with Lesson 13.  You will read through the passage, compose a translation, then watch (or re-watch) the _Hebrew Quest_ video where Izzy walks us through the passage.  There is more information on this in the Unit 3 introduction.

Lastly, you might be encouraged by this article on [conquering the Fog](./images/00_Fog_Article.pdf){target="_blank"}.  The "Fog" is a term coined by Dr. Bill Mounce, author of _Basics of Biblical Greek_.  "Fog" describes the feeling that you aren't making any progress in learning a Biblical language when you actually are making TREMENDOUS progress!

## Information Boxes {-}

As you work though the Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest guidebook, you will notice several different information boxes uses to call out various topics.

REQUIRED: 

* Other than being a subscriber to Holy Language Institute, you will not need to purchase or obtain anything for this course (unless you want to)
* You will need a computer with internet access, a free Google account to open and complete documents and exercises, the free Anki desktop software to do the flashcard activities, and a pen or a pencil to complete writing worksheets

OPTIONAL:

Below are additional resources, some of which are free and some paid:

* Free of charge
  * Thanks to his extremely generous reuse license, we have leveraged many of the worksheets and content from [Dr. John Beckman](https://hebrewsyntax.org/bbh2new/){target="_blank"}.  If you want more detail into any lesson, you may wish to refer to his videos and handouts.  Everything on [his site](https://hebrewsyntax.org/bbh2new/){target="_blank"} is free.
  * Dr. Bill Mounce has study guides available for each Chapter of _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_
    * In most cases, these will not add much to the lessons in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, but some students might find them valuable
    * For Chapter 1, click [http://hebrew.billmounce.com/BasicsBiblicalHebrew-01.pdf](http://hebrew.billmounce.com/BasicsBiblicalHebrew-01.pdf){target="_blank"}; for other chapters, change the `01` in the URL to the chapter number you are seeking^[Except Chapter 4, which for some reason, is not available.]
* Paid
  * Anki's iOS app requires a one-time purchase through the Apple store of $25.  If you have an iPhone, we believe this is a relatively inexpensive investment in your Hebrew journey, but the decision to purchase is entirely up to you.  You would be able to complete the course without purchase of the app.
  * To further supplement your studies, you may wish to purchase the _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_ textbook or any of the accompanying resources
    * [Basics of Biblical Hebrew Textbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031053349X/&tag=holylanginst-20)

While this is a self-paced course with no formal instructor or teaching assistant, we want to provide a way for you to get help and ask a question should you get stuck.

We request that before you submit a question, you read through the lesson a couple of times, then attempt to do the Anki cards for that lesson.  Sometimes by doing this, things will "click" on their own.  If you are still unclear, we are here!

Use the form below to ask a question. Please note, we are staffed by volunteers, so please allow a few days for us to research and get back to you.
