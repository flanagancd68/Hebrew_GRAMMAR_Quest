The reason we study Biblical Hebrew grammar is so we can better understand Biblical Hebrew.

We'd like you to think of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest as an extension of _Hebrew Quest_.   If you were to take a hypothetical microscope and inspect Lessons 12-15 of _Hebrew Quest_, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is what you would see. 

For those who finished _Hebrew Quest_, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will be a logical next step.  For those who have started, but hit some roadblocks, we believe Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest can provide you with important underlying Hebrew concepts so you can then return to _Hebrew Quest_ and finish up.  In fact we're going to help you with this goal: In the second half of this grammar course, we will incorporate several of the [Study Passage](https://holylanguage.com/ot-readings.html) sections of _Hebrew Quest_.  

Whether you have completed all, some, or none of _Hebrew Quest_, and have an interest in learning some of the inner workings of Hebrew, then we'd say you're in the right place!

Here are some additional FAQ about the two courses:

* [What is the difference between _Hebrew Quest_ and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest?](#difference)
* [Do I need to complete _Hebrew Quest_ before I start Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest?](#complete_hq_first) The short answer is: NO!
* [When I complete this course, should I go back and finish _Hebrew Quest_?](#need_to_finish_hq) The Short answer is: YES!
*  [I haven't started either course.  Which should I do first?](#which_first) The short answer is start _Hebrew Quest_ through Lesson 11, then hop over to Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, then return and finish _Hebrew Quest_.

<!-- Here is how we would characterize the two courses: -->

<!-- * Hebrew Quest took you directly <u>TO</u> the Hebrew Scriptures ("macro" view).   -->
<!-- * Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to take you <u>INSIDE</u> the Hebrew Scriptures ("micro" view). -->
