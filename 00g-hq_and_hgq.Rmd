> The reason we study Biblical Hebrew grammar is so we can better understand Biblical Hebrew.

We like to think of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest as an extension of Hebrew Quest. Both courses work to advance you towards the primary goal of independently reading and comprehending the Hebrew Scriptures.

For those who finished Hebrew Quest, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will be a logical next step.  For those who have started Hebrew Quest but hit some roadblocks, we believe Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest can provide you with important underlying Hebrew concepts. 

Whether you have completed all, some<small>^[<small>As we said in the [Motivation for this course](#motivation) section, we know many folks got stuck in the grammar lessons of Hebrew Quest.  We wrote this course specifically with you in mind!</small>]</small>, or none<small>^[<small>If you're in the "none" category, you might want to watch the Hebrew Quest Aleph-Bet lectures (Lessons 1-11) and then return to this course; but this is entirely optional.</small>]</small>. of Hebrew Quest, and have an interest in learning some of the inner workings of Hebrew, you're in the right place!

Additionally, in the second half of this grammar course, we will incorporate several of the [Study Passage](https://holylanguage.com/ot-readings.html) sections of Hebrew Quest.  

Check out the [Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest FAQs](#hq_hgq_faq) for a more in-depth discussion on this topic.

<!-- Here is how we would characterize the two courses: -->

<!-- * Hebrew Quest took you directly <u>TO</u> the Hebrew Scriptures ("macro" view).   -->
<!-- * Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to take you <u>INSIDE</u> the Hebrew Scriptures ("micro" view). -->
