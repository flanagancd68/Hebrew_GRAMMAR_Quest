> The reason we study Biblical Hebrew grammar is so we can better comprehend Biblical Hebrew.

Both courses work together to advance you towards the primary goal of independently reading and comprehending the Hebrew Scriptures.

For those who finished Hebrew Quest, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will be logical next step.  For others who have started Hebrew Quest but hit some roadblocks, we believe Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest can provide you with important underlying Hebrew concepts, which you can then use to finish Hebrew Quest.  

Whether you have completed, all, some<small>^[<small>As we said in the [Motivation for this course](#motivation) section, we know there are a many folks who got stuck in the grammar lessons of Hebrew Quest.  We wrote this course specifically with you in mind!</small>]</small>, or none<small>^[<small>If you're in the "none" category, you might want to watch the Hebrew Quest Aleph-Bet lectures (Lessons 1-11) and then return to this course; but this is entirely optional.</small>]</small>. of Hebrew Quest, and have an interest in learning some of the inner workings of Hebrew, you're in the right place!

Also, in the second half of this grammar course, we will incorporate several of the [Study Passage](https://holylanguage.com/ot-readings.html) sections of Hebrew Quest.

<!-- Here is how we would characterize the two courses: -->

<!-- * Hebrew Quest took you directly <u>TO</u> the Hebrew Scriptures ("macro" view).   -->
<!-- * Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to take you <u>INSIDE</u> the Hebrew Scriptures ("micro" view). -->
