Many Hebrew grammar courses and books treat learning God's Holy Language as if it were just another academic exercise. Listen to a lecture, read a chapter, take a test, and you'll learn Hebrew. 

At Holy Language, we believe that we learn best by doing. If you watched the original Hebrew Quest, you might remember Izzy Avraham, our founder, talking about feeding someone a fish, versus showing someone how to fish<small>^[<small>Refer to Hebrew Quest, Lesson 1.</small>]</small>.  Other approaches may "feed" you Hebrew. Learning  Hebrew grammar, the Holy Language Way, means we're going to show you how to teach yourself Hebrew and actively (dare we say "passionately") ***engage*** with the Hebrew Scriptures.

So what you're reading right now is not just a textbook.  It is an interactive guidebook to your PERSONAL Hebrew _Grammar_ <u>Quest</u>!


## How the lessons are arranged {-}

As we were thinking about how to design the book, we were struck by the similarities between traveling to Israel and learning Hebrew Grammar.

According to Dr. Wayne Stiles, to get the most out of a tour to Israel, one must actively undergo three stages of preparation<small>^[<small>Stiles, Wayne. “How to Prepare for a Holy Land Tour.” Wayne Stiles. February 20, 2013. https://waynestiles.com/how-to-prepare-for-a-holy-land-tour/. Accessed September 28, 2020.</small>]</small>:

1. Practical Preparation - getting a "lay of the land"
2. Physical Preparation - getting in shape to do a lot of walking and combating jet lag
3. Spiritual Preparation - preparing to meet Yeshua in a life-changing way

### We believe these exact principles apply when learning Hebrew the Holy Language way! {-}


## 1. Practical Preparation - Seven Practical Points {-}

### Getting a grammatical lay of the land {- .unlisted}

* In Israel, things like electrical outlets and certain customs are different. In the same way, Hebrew has characteristics and "customs" that are very different from English.
* This guidebook<small>^[<small>We are your Hebrew grammar tour guide.  This is why why we are calling this a "guidebook" instead of a "textbook"!</small>]</small> has 35 lessons, each with a set of learning objectives we call __Seven Practical Points__`<small>^[<small>The lesson format generally follows that of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> by Dr. Gary Pratico and Dr. Myles Van Pelt.  We make extensive use of derivative works by Dr. John Beckman, whose material accombanying <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> is freely available under the Creative Commons (CC-BY-SA) license.</small>]</small>   
* These __Seven Practical Points__ are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of the given topic.  We just want to give you an overview to get your journey started in the right direction.

But don't feel that we've let you fend for yourself like a tourist in a Jerusalem traffic jam!  We have a workout plan to get you into Hebrew Health, and we have established checks to make sure you have all the right equipment in your pack before you continue in your quest.

## 2a. Physical Preparation - `Anki Aerobics` {-}

### Getting Hebrew Healthy  {- .unlisted}

* In Israel you do a lot of walking so you need to be in physical shape.  Hebrew similarly has a lot of grammatical hills to climb, so we need to get Hebrew Healthy.
* To get in Hebrew shape, we're not going to go to a physical gym, but there is a powerful piece of equipment that will build your Hebrew strength and endurance.  It's called Anki.  
    * The majority of your work in this course will be doing what we call `Anki Aerobics`
    * There is an entire section in the Appendices devoted to [Anki](#anki_faq).  It will show you how to get the program set up and how to get our custom **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest** deck loaded. (***YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THIS NOW***)
    * There will be three phases of Anki Aerobics with each Lesson: `Vocabulary`, `Grammar` concepts from the Lesson (expanding on the Seven Practical Points), and `Verses` (Bible verse translation)

## 2b. Physical Preparation - `Quest Quiz` / `Equipment Check` {-}

### Combating "the fog" {- .unlisted}

* One can't fly halfway around the world and not experience jet lag. "The Fog"<small>^[<small>"The Fog" is a term coined by Dr. Bill Mounce, author of <u>Basics of Biblical Greek</u>, to describe the phenomenon of studying a grammar concept, thinking you understand it; but, you don't really understand it. .</small>]</small>  is grammar's version of jet lag.
* Often, concepts you learn may not make sense until a lesson or two later.  This is natural and we just need to go with it.
* Just like jet lag after a flight that lasts over 10 hours, we can't avoid the grammar fog completely, but we can minimize it.
    * Anki's automatic review process<small>^[<small>By this we mean the *scheduling* and *queuing* of items to review is automatic.  You still need to do the work!</small>]</small> will be a huge help in working through The Fog.
    * Each lesson will have a `Quest Quiz` for you to assess your progress. No grades are ever recorded in the course, but if you do get a lower score on a `Quest Quiz`, that could be an indication you aren't quite ready to move on.
    * Most lessons will have an `Equipment Check` - We want to make sure you have the right supplies (i.e. grammar concepts from the previous chapter) in your backpack before you journey forward.
* As Dr. Mounce says, if you find yourself getting discouraged, just look a couple of chapters back and you will probably now understand that chapter clearly.

## 3. Spiritual Preparation {-}

### Preparing to meet Yeshua in a life-changing way {- .unlisted}


A trip to Israel is not like any other "vacation" - it's a spiritual journey. Unfortunately, all some do is see some cool sites and take some pictures.  Imagine going all that way only to miss a tremendous opportunity to meet Yeshua in His extraordinary Land.

Similarly, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is a spiritual journey! 

Suppose we view learning grammar as strictly an academic effort. We would risk missing insights Yeshua might want to teach us. 

We have three aspects of being spiritually intentional in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest: *prayer*, *scripture reading*, and *encouragement.*

Since this is the most important part of the course, we're going to take each of these aspects as individual sections.

## 3a. **Prayer**: `Lesson Prayer` {- .unlisted}

> Philippians 4:6-7 Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in Yeshua our Messiah. 

* We want to begin each lesson with `Lesson Prayer`
    * Each lesson will start with a suggested prayer topic
    * You can focus on this, or maybe something else that is on your heart
    * Pray and be open to what Yeshua may be teaching you
    
## 3b. **Scripture**: `Verses Warm-up Video` /  `Study Verses` / `Ruth Pursuits` {- .unlisted}

> 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (NASB) All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17 so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.

* In a "Biblical Hebrew" class, it goes to follow that there should be a lot of "Bible"!  

We have `Ruth Pursuits` "scavenger hunts" and `Study Verses` in Anki that will accompany each lesson.  Eventually, we will link up with Hebrew Quest and have a look at the [`Study Passages`](https://holylanguage.com/ot-readings.html)

* `Ruth Pursuits` - 
    * We will grammar concepts while learning to read Ruth 1, the beautiful passage of Scripture where a gentile bride commits herself to serve the God of Israel.
    * If you recall the "bag the letter" activities from the initial Hebrew Quest lessons, the `Ruth Pursuits` are similar.
    * We will give you some things to find (like a scavenger hunt) and then we send you off into the grammar wilderness for you to find them in the Hebrew of Ruth Chapter 1.
* `Study Verses` 
    * You will read and begin to translate passages of Scripture in Anki
    * Similar to the `Vocab Warm-up Video`, we have the `Verses Warm-up Video`. You'll also listen to the audio by Izzy to begin to hear the sound of the language
    * There are over 400 study verses across all 35 lessons!
* `Study Passages`
    * Starting with Lesson 18, we will add an additional ACTIVity to read one of the `Study Passages` from **Hebrew Quest**<small>^[<small>If you're wondering about ACTIVity workload, starting with the second half of the course, the `Ruth Pursuits` will gradually give way to the Hebrew Quest `Study Passages`. The second half of the course is all about the derived verb stems.  Ruth 1 has comparatively few of these to be found.</small>]</small>.
    * You will read it initially on your own and highlight anything you don't know
    * Then you will watch the video with Izzy's guided reading and commentary

## 3c. **Encouragement**: `Twelve Tribes Badges` and `Graduation` {.unnumbered .unlisted}

> 1 Thessalonians 5:11 (NASB) Therefore, encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.

* Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is not a quick sprint.  It's a long journey for which you will need intense training. It will be critical to stay encouraged to finish the quest!
* `Twelve Tribes Badges`<small>^[<small>Only one badge is available in the preview version of the course.</small>]</small>
    * Each of the Twelve Tribes has an emblem or symbol that has traditionally be associated with that tribe
    * Taken in total, all Twelve Tribes can teach us different aspects of our relationships with God and our neighbors
    * After two or three lessons, you will have the ability to "unlock" a new badge and learn more about what that tribe represents for us
    * We will ask you to confirm that you have completed all listed ACTIVities up to that point. Once you do this, you will receive your badge!
* `Graduation`<small>^[<small>Not available in the preview version of the course.</small>]</small>
        * For Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, there will be a `Graduation ` process, similar to what we have for [Hebrew Quest](https://holylanguage.com/graduate.html){target="_blank"}
        * At the end of each unit, you will be eligible for a `Certificate`
        * When you finish the entire course, we'll send you a printable `Diploma` and your choice of a clay lamp or Hebrew letters mug<small>^[<small>Why not complete both Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest so you can earn the lamp **AND** the mug!</small>]</small>

## ACTIVities {-}

So you can see this course is going to be jam-packed with things to do.  In keeping with our philosophy that active learning is better than passive learning, we refer to our activities as as `ACTIVities`.  You'll recognize an ACTIVity in this book by `this special font`.

When you see an ACTIVity, just remember that it's all part of us showing you how to fish instead of just telling you about fishing!


### A typical lesson's ACTIVities {-}

1. **Practical Preparation** - Seven Practical Points, the key learning objectives from each Lesson
2. **Physical Preparation**
    1. `Video Warm-ups` (starting with Lesson 3)
    1. `Anki Aerobics`
    2. `Worksheets` (selected lessons only)
