This graphic shows the evolution of Hebrew. Top to bottom: proto-Canaanite (~1600 BCE), paleo-Hebrew (~900 BCE), Rashi (1500 CE), Ketav Stam (used in Torah scrolls and other formal documents), contemporary block, and modern cursive. This course will use the contemporary block style. For more history and discussion on the other script forms, see Hebrew Quest, lessons 2-11.  In this initial lesson we will meet the Hebrew Aleph-Bet.  The letters are like a family, and with any family there can be interesting dynamics (including not always playing nice with each other!).  The bulk of the lesson will take a look at some of those dynamics.

**Equipment Check**

If you are eager to jump right in with Lesson 1, we understand totally.  We are also excited for you to start!

"Equipment Check" is where we will pause before each lesson to make sure you have the right tools and supplies in your backpack before heading on the next phase of your Quest.  In future lessons, we will want to make sure you have an understanding of specific concepts before continuing<small>^[<small>See discussion on ["The Fog"](#the-fog) in the appendix</small>]</small>


Before continuing, make sure of the following:

*  You read the [Introduction](#hgq_and_hq)
*  You understand what will [a typical lesson](#typical-lesson) will include
*  You followed the steps on our [Quick Start Instructions](#get_started), are ready go to with `Anki` and have your `Course Checklist` to track your progress

knitr::include_graphics("images/01_Cove of the Sower from top, tbs76029303.jpg")
``` 

<small>Note: acoustic tests have been performed at this location that have confirmed that a person in a boat in the middle of the cove can _easily_ be heard without amplification by people sitting on these rocks several hundred feet up the embankment (and Yeshua didn't have to deal with road noise!).  A description of the acoustics study can be found in the following article: Crisler, B. "The Acoustics and Crowd Capacity of Natural Theaters in Palestine." Biblical Archaeologist, vol. 39, no. 4 (1976):128–41.</small>


## The Hebrew Aleph-Bet {#consonants}

```{r, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/alephbet.png")
```

Almost every other grammar book would start with a lengthy description of each letter, how to write it, and how to pronounce it.  We omit this because this is (and much more!) covered in detail in [_Hebrew Quest_ Lessons 2-11](https://holylanguage.com/letters.html){target="_blank"}.  The points below and on the following pages will provide some foundations so your grammar journey gets started in the right direction.

* All letters you see in the picture of the Aleph-Bet above are classified as "consonants."

* Whereas English has the vowel letters (A, E, I, O, U) as a core part of the Aleph-Bet, Hebrew treats vowels differently

* א and ע are not vowels but silent consonants; in Sephardic pronunciation, they take on the pronunciation of their associated vowel (if there is one)

* We'll talk about vowels in Lesson 2


## Hebrew is written and read from RIGHT-to-LEFT {#right_to_left}

Note the front of a Hebrew book is in the same location as the back of an English one:

```{r, , fig.show="hold", out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/right_to_left.png")
include_graphics("images/hebrewbook.png")
```

* To our western eyes, this looks "backward" (but Israelis would say _we_ are reading backward!)

* When reading Hebrew, always start at the "back" and go from RIGHT to LEFT

## Five "KiMNePaTZ" letters have different final forms {#sofit_letters}

```{r, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kimnepatz.gif")
```

* Hebrew does not have capital letters the way English does, but a somewhat similar concept is five letters take what are called “Final” or “Sofit”<small>^[<small>_Sofit_ is just the Hebrew word for final</small>]</small> forms when they appear at the END of a word
    * Those letters are in red text above
* The names of these letters is quite simple
    * Take the letter Kaf כּ, which is the first letter in the Aleph-bet with a sofit form
    * The final form is named Kaf Sofit ך. Same for Mem מ and Mem sofit ם and so on<small>^[<small>"Final Kaf," "Final Mem," etc., are also terms you may hear.</small>]</small>
* The five letters that have these forms are the letters, Kaf, Mem, Nun, Pei, and Tsaddi: ך ם ן ף ץ
* You can remember the acronym, KiMNePaTZ, which is the made-up word you get when you string the five letters in a row
* The KiMNePaTZ sofit forms can look like other letters - your `Anki` work for this Lesson will give you practice with identifying look-alike letters

## Six" BeGaD KePHaT" letters take a Daghesh Lene {#daghesh_lene}

```{r, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bdgkpt.gif")
```

* The next sub-group of letters you need to study are the "BeGaD Kephat" letters<small>^[<small>See also Lesson 3 of Hebrew Quest</small>]</small>
* The red dot in the above letters is called a **DAGHESH LENE**
* The Daghesh Lene is inserted into the middle of the consonant
    * The pronunciation of the letter is hard if the Daghesh Lene present or soft if not present
        * so ב has a "soft b" sound, in other words a "v" sound
        * בּ has a "hard b" sound, in other words a "b" sound
        * כ sounds like the "ch" in "bach", while כּ is "k" as in "kite"
        * פ is the "ph" in "phone", while פּ is the "p" in "pull"
    * The Daghesh Forte ONLY applies to Bet - Gimmel - Dalet - Kaf - Pei - and Tav 
* At one time, all six of these letters had different pronunciations, but today, only three do.  These are the letters in blue above: **בּ כּ פּ**
    * Since the letters without the Daghesh Lene want to be "lazy" - for example a weak 'v' instead of a strong 'b'- our mnemonic for these is "BuCK uP! You Lazy Letters!"


We’ll dig deeper into the Daghesh Lene and its much more important twin, the Daghesh Forte, over the next few lessons.


## We classify four consonants as **Gutturals** (and one is a sometimes-guttural) {#gutturals}

```{r, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gutturals.gif")
```

### How the Gutturals behave is one of the most critical facets of Hebrew grammar {-}

* There are four proper gutturals: Aleph, Hei, Chet, and Ayin (in red above)
 * The letter Resh ר (in orange above) is not formally a Guttural; but since it can’t decide whether to behave or not, sometimes we include Resh with the other Gutturalsl
* We like to say that the gutturals will be our trouble-makers because they tend not to play nice with the other Hebrew rules 
    * The good news is the behavior of the Gutturals and Resh is entirely predictable
    * We will learn this over the next few lessons (and indeed, the rest of the course) 
* For now, memorize the group of four guttural consonants in red and Resh, the sometimes-guttural-like letter in orange.


## Look out for look-alike Letters {#look-alike-letters}

```{r, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/lookalikes.png")
```

* Hebrew has many letters that can look similar, especially to someone just learning the Aleph-bet
    * The `Anki` deck will give you practice on distinguishing these.
    * Also, in Hebrew Quest, when Izzy reviewed the Aleph-Bet in lessons 2-11, he talked about each letter’s "twin" and how to spot the difference 
    * We encourage you to revisit those [letter lessons](https://holylanguage.com/letters.html). 

```{r, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/01.izzy_aleph.jpg")
```

## Sephardic vs "Seminary" Pronunciation {#pronunciation}

```{r, out.width = "800pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/vav.png")
```

* There are some notable differences between what we might call academic or "seminary<small>^[<small>"Seminary Hebrew" is a term borrowed from Dr. John Beckman. We don't say "Seminary Hebrew" to be disrespectful; we only mean to differentiate between the two pronunciation types.</small>]</small>" Hebrew and "real-world" Hebrew.  Seminary pronunciation is in red above, while Sephardic pronunciation is in blue.
    * Real-world Hebrew is based on Sephardic pronunciation
* We've already talked about how only three of the Daghesh Lene letters need to "buck up"
* With "Seminary Hebrew," the ג without the Daghesh Lene receives something like the GH in "aGHast." The ד and ת without the Daghesh Lene are closer to the English DH/TH like "this." 
* Another difference between Sephardic and Seminary pronunciation is how to pronounce ו 
    * In academia, the consonant receives the "w" sound and is called "Waw." 
    * In most non-academic circles, it receives the "v" sound and is pronounced "vav."
* There are also significant differences in pronouncing vowels, which we will talk about in Lesson 2.
* For the most part, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will follow the Sephardic pronunciation
* We will use "Adonai" or "the LORD" when we encounter the Covenant Name.

## Lesson Conclusion and Activities {-}

Congratulations on completing your first lesson.  If you look to the left, you should see 1.1 through 1.7 (hit the `s` key if you don't see it).  After each lesson, take a moment to review list of the Seven Practical Points. Don't hesitate to go back and re-review anything that might be a bit fuzzy.

Now we'll move into the Physical Activity<small>^[<small>If you're wondering why we call it a "physical" activity, see [this discussion](#physical) in the appendix.</small>]</small> stage of the Lesson.  This is where you take what you learned above and put it into practice using `Anki`.  For this lesson, we also have a `worksheet` and an additional writing activity.

### `Anki` {- #anki-1}

* `Lesson 01 A. Vocab` - Learn (or relearn) the Aleph-Bet with Izzy. 
* `Lesson 01 B. Grammar` - Identify look-alike Hebrew letters.
* `Lesson 01 C. Study Verses` - we won't be working on any Study Verses just yet, but we will learn some grammar shorthand that we will use when we get to Lesson 3.

Access Anki using your mobile app, desktop version, or [the web-based version (login may be required)](https://ankiweb.net/decks/){target="_blank"}

### `Worksheets`: Letter Writing {- #worksheets-1}

1. Practice writing the letters individually using the [Letter Writing worksheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JcX8kc6e-fKjtzkeE96AwoZFshEpx3ug/view){target="_blank"}
    * If you would like some tips on how to write the letters, you can use [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cmrCXcafjwvbMNj7GgX7UPMGA0FcwvWN/view?usp=sharing){target="_blank"} from Dr. Beckman.
    * As we've said before, we strongly encourage everone to watch (or re-watch) the [_Hebrew Quest_ lessons on the Aleph-Bet](https://holylanguage.com/letters.html){target="_blank"}
    
2. Practice writing the entire AlephBet until you can do it FIVE times from memory.  This will also be an instruction on the Quest Quiz.
