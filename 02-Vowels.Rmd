> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must understand how words are formed and pronounced

Even though our goal may not necessarily be to converse in Biblical Hebrew, hearing the sound of the language aides our learning.  Vowels are what give a language its distinctive sound.  In Hebrew, the same three consonants can change meaning depending on the vowel combination.

As Izzy says in Hebrew Quest, “Vowels are important.”  On your screen, you see Genesis 1:9.  The black font shows the text with no vowels. Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red.  These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is _nikudot_. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses.  These marks also show where the word's accent is.<small>^[<small>Image Source: Originally uploaded as en:File:Example of biblical Hebrew trope.svg on 04:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC) by en:User:SyntaxError55. </small>]</small>

## Seven Practical Points for Lesson 2 {-}

1. Memorize vowels that are not vowel letters
1. Learn vocal sheva and silent sheva
1. Memorize the vowel letters
1. Meet "defective" and "plene" spelling 
1. Meet Daghesh Lene's twin, Daghesh Forte
1. Know the rule for a Daghesh Forte
1. Know that the Gutturals and Resh reject Daghesh Forte

### `Lesson Prayer` {-}

Pray not just for knowledge, but for wisdom.

> (James 1:5 NASB) But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.

## `Equipment Check` {-}

```

Before continuing, can you recite the following groups of letters from memory?

* All twenty-two consonants of the Hebrew Aleph-Bet 
* The six BeGaD KePHaT letters
* The five KiMNePaTZ letters
* The four guttural letters and the one sometimes-guttural letter

## Vowels that are not vowel letters {#vowels}

### Vowels come in three types: Long, Short, Reduced | Vowels come in five classes: A, E, I, O, U {-}

Like the Aleph-bet, we are going to have to commit the vowels in the table below to memory. Knowing the vowel types and classes will make your grammatical life much more comfortable in the future.  The Anki exercises will break down each component and quiz you on small sections at a time.  Eventually, you'll get it!

Notes:

* The letter בּ is provided as a placeholder
* Say the vowel _after_ saying the associated consonant<small>^[<small>We will learn that Hebrew loves to break the rules.  In the next lesson, we will learn about an exception to the "vowel comes after" rule, called the *furtive patach*.</small>]</small> So the first vowel example is "baw" not "awb".

```{r, out.width = "500pt", fig.align='center'}

include_graphics("images/02.vowels_not_letters.png")
```


Notes:

* Future lessons will explain the difference between Qamets and Qamets Hatuf
* Only **gutturals** take the "Hateph" vowels - to make it easier, we can pronounce all three Hateph vowels like the A in <u>A</u>muse
* You might see Kibbuts, Kibbutz, Qibbutz, and Qibbuts used interchangeably
* Interestingly, if you ever learned Spanish, the name of the vowels in Spanish are roughly how the long and short vowels are pronounced in Hebrew.  Perhaps you remember the Spanish mnemonic "a e i o u - arbolito de Peru"!


## Vocal  and Silent Sheva {#sheva}

* Both are written as בְּ 
  * Both mark the END of a syllable
* VOCAL Sheva<small>^[<small>Many academic textbooks will use the term "Shewa" instead of "Sheva". Both words mean the same thing.</small>]</small> is a REDUCED vowel 
  *  Only non-gutturals can take a Vocal Sheva
      * Gutturals **reject** the Vocal Sheva and take the Hateph vowels instead
    * Pronounced like the A in <u>A</u>muse (same as Hateph Patach)
* SILENT Sheva is NOT A Vowel
    * <u>Any</u> letter can take a Silent Sheva
    * Silent/ No sound

> We will learn how to distinguish between the two kinds of Sheva in the next lesson

## Vowel letters {#vowel_letters}

### Vowel letters use a consonant plus a nikkud to form a vowel {-}

Another table to memorize:

```{r, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}

include_graphics("images/02.vowels_letters.png")
```

* Shureq is pronounced like Qibbuts (r<u>u</u>ler)
* Hireq Yod is pronounced like the i in mach<u>i</u>ne
* All others are pronounced like their non-vowel-letter counterparts
* Yod and Vav vowels - י,ו 
    * These are Long Vowels that do not reduce
    * Therefore they are called "irreducible (unchangeable) long vowels"<small>^[<small>We'll explain what this means in the next lesson</small>]</small>
    * These occur in the middle or at the end of a word
* Hei Vowels - ה
    * Seghol Hei is a short vowel - the other Hei vowels are long
    * Hei vowels **ONLY** occur at the end of a word 
    * Hei vowels are extremely common in Hebrew


## "Defective" and "plene" spelling {#defective_spelling}

### In "defective" spelling, letter vowels can sometimes drop their letter and take on the corresponding non-letter vowel. The meaning of the word doesn’t change. {-}

This is the word for "laws" showing both "plene" spelling (left) and "defective" spelling (right):

```{r, out.width = "500pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/defective.gif")
```

* Three vowel letters commonly take "defective" forms<small>^[<small>"Defective", in this sense, does not have a negative connotation.</small>]</small>
    * Holem-vav can drop the Vav and contract to Holem, as in the example above
    * Hireq-Yod can drop the Yod and contract to Hireq
    * Shuruq can drop the Vav and it's associated nikkud and contract to Qibbuts
    
The qamets-hei ה ָ  sometimes drops the final ה, leaving just the qamets under the now-final letter.
    
Over time, you’ll start to develop a mental checklist when you encounter something that doesn’t make sense. “Could this be a defective spelling?” will be one of those checklist items.

## The Daghesh Forte {#daghesh_forte}

### A Daghesh Forte doubles the consonant {-}

Notice the שּׁ in הַשָּׁמַיִם:

```{r, out.width = "500pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/02.daghesh_forte.gif")
```
 
* Since שׁ is not a בגד כפת letter, we know this *cannot* be a Daghesh Lene, but it is a Daghesh **Forte**
* The letter with the Daghesh Forte both ends one syllable and begins the next syllable
    * If we were to syllabify הַשָּׁמַיִם, it would look something like the bottom line in the picture above (pronounce: `hash-sha-mayim`)<small>^[<small> `Mayim` is one syllable as we will learn in Lesson 3.  הַשָּׁמַיִם means "the heavens."  From now on, we won't always provide a translation for every new word you encounter.  It's more important that you focus on the concepts.  You will have PLENTY of vocabulary work in Anki!</small>]</small>
* A similar word in English might be better = bet | ter
    * If we were to transliterate better into Hebrew hypothetically,  it might look like: בּטֶּר*<small>^[<small>The * means this is not a real Hebrew word, but we show it in this form for illustration.</small>]</small>
* Notice the syllable breaks in these words that have a Daghesh Forte:
```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}

include_graphics("images/02.forte.png")
```
* Any consonant (except for Gutturals and Resh) can take a Dagesh Forte, including a בגד כפת letter, which can take either a Daghesh Lene or a Daghesh Forte
    * The "Buck-up" letters will take the **hard** pronunciation regardless of a Daghesh Lene or Daghesh Forte - See the final word אַתָּה in the image above

_Advanced tip:_ When you see a Daghesh Forte, it often means that another letter has disappeared<small>^[<small>Not entirely unlike the English apostrophe in words like _can't_.</small>]</small>.  We will talk more about this later in the course.

We will have much more to say about syllabification in Lesson 3.

## Daghesh Forte Rule {#daghesh_forte_in_bgdkpt}

### "A Daghesh is a Forte if, and only if, it's preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva." ---John Beckman {-}

That's it.  That's the rule<small>^[<small>Strictly speaking, there are exceptions, but you won't encounter them in a first-year Hebrew course</small>]</small>.  

Quiz yourself with these examples (answers below):

* אַתָּה = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>Yes, a patach. Daghesh Forte</small>]</small>
* בְּרֵאשִׁית = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>No. Daghesh Lene</small>]</small>
* עַל־פְּנֵי = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>No. Daghesh Lene.  The "hyphen" looking mark is called a Maqquef.  It has the same function as the Hyphen does in English.</small>]</small>
* מַבְדִּיל = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>No, it is preceded by a Sheva. Daghesh Lene.</small>]</small>
* מִתַּחַת  = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>Yes, a Hiriq. Daghesh Forte</small>]</small>


## Gutturals and Resh reject Daghesh Forte {#gutturals_reject_daghesh_forte}

* We said in Lesson One that the Gutturals don’t play nice with the other Hebrew Rules, and this rejection of the Daghesh Forte is one of those ways
* A Hebrew collision like this means something has to give. . . and the gutturals tend to get their way.
* It's like they have a force-field shielding them from other Hebrew grammar rules!

```{r, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="That's no moon.  That's a Guttural!"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/02.reject.gif")
```

* A large chunk of any Hebrew grammar course involes learning to resolve these guttural entanglements.

## `Ruth Pursuit` {-}

### Your Quest: {-}

1. Identify the four UNCHANGEABLE LONG vowels that use YOD in Verse 1 (blue)<small>^[<small>In most word processors, you won't be able to isolate the vowel to highlight. Get as close as you can.</small>]</small>|
2. Identify the two UNCHANGEABLE LONG vowels that use VAV in Verse 1 (Green)
3. Identify QAMETS HEI in Verse 1.  There is a TSERE Hei between Verses 5-10.  Can you find it?<small>^[<small>The other vowels that use hei are less common, but we will see them when we discuss verbs.</small>]</small> (Purple)
4. Identify the three LONG vowels in Verse 1 (that are not part of a vowel letter) (pink)|
5. Identify three of the five SHORT vowels in Verse 1 (that are not part of a vowel letter)<small>^[<small>We haven't learned to spot Qamets Hatuf yet, and Qibbuts does not appear in this passage</small>]</small> (red)
6. Five the three REDUCED/HATEPHH vowels, including Hateph Qamets Hatuf<small>^[<small>You should be able to make out the word that has the Hateph Qamets Hatuph</small>]</small>.  They are in verses 2-4. (grey)
7. One of the more common verbs in the Tanach is **וַיֹּאמֶר **, which means "(and) he said. 
    * Vav-Patach-**Yod**-Daghesh Forte --וַיּ to start a verb means "And he (did or was something)  
    * If we change the second consonant from a Yod to a **Tav**, we get --וָתּ, "and **S**he (did or was something).  
            * Thus, וַתֹּאמֶר means "and she said."  
            * Challenge: Find the five instances of וַתֹּאמֶר in Ruth Chapter 1<small>^[<small>In at least three of the cases, you should be able to figure out who is speaking.</small>]</small>  (yellow)
