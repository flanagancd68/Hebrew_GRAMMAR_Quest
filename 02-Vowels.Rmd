> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must understand how words are formed and pronounced

As Izzy says in _Hebrew Quest_, “vowels are important!”  Even though our goal may not necessarily be to converse in Biblical Hebrew, hearing the language's sound aids our learning.  Vowels are what give a language its distinctive sound, and are what give words their meaning.  Consider the simple English words "bay," "boy," and "buy."  These words have identical consonants but mean very different things because of the different vowels.  It is the same with Hebrew.

```

Above, you see Genesis 1:9.  The black font shows the text with no vowels. This is how the Hebrew Bible was originally written.  Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red.  These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is _nikudot_ which is the plural form of the word _nikkud_. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses.  These marks also show where the word's accent is.^[Image Source: Originally uploaded as en:File:Example of biblical Hebrew trope.svg on 04:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC) by en:User:SyntaxError55. ]  We will talk more about Cantillation marks in Unit 3.

The table below lists the vowels that are not vowel letters.  This table MUST be memorized, including type and class as well as the name and symbol.

::: {.box .light}
* The Anki exercises will help us to commit this table to memory, so you don't necessarily need to drop everything and memorize the table below!
* Review the table and get familiar with it; then review the discussion points on the next slide
:::

* The letter בּ is provided as a placeholder
* Say the vowel _after_ saying the associated consonant^[We will learn that Hebrew loves to break the rules.  In the next lesson, we will learn about an exception to the "vowel comes after" rule, called the *furtive patach*.]. 
  * So, the first vowel example is "baw" not "awb."

### Vowels come in three types: Long, Short, Reduced | Vowels come in five classes: A, E, I, O, U {-}

* We memorized the Aleph-bet in Lesson 1, but this knowledge is incomplete without vowels
  * Make sure you can say the name and know how to write the specific vowels
  * We also must know the vowel types (Long, Short, Reduced) and classes (A, E, I, O, or U) 
  * This will make your grammatical life much more comfortable in the future
*   Only **gutturals** take the "Hateph" vowels - 
  * To make it easier, we can pronounce all three Hateph vowels like the A in <u>A</u>muse
  * Hateph vowels are used because Gutturals reject Vocal Sheva
  * We label the reduced O class, "Hateph Qamets Hatuf"
    * Note that other grammars may label this vowel, "Hateph Qamets"
    * Our label, "Hateph Qamets Hatuf," reminds us that this is the reduced O class, not to be confused with the A class Qamets, even though the symbols are the same
    *   A future section will explain the difference between Qamets and Qamets Hatuf
    * For now, remember Qamets is Long A and Qamets Hatuf is Short O

* The Sheva can be tricky to grasp at first since vocal and silent Sheva are written the same. They have two very different uses^[Many academic textbooks will use the term "Shewa" instead of "Sheva". Both words mean the same thing.].
* Both are written as קְ
  * Both types of a Sheva mark the END of a syllable
* VOCAL Sheva is a REDUCED vowel but does NOT have a vowel Class
  *  Only non-gutturals can take a Vocal Sheva
      * Gutturals **reject** the Vocal Sheva and take the Hateph vowels instead
    * Pronounced like the A in <u>A</u>muse (same as Hateph Patach)
* SILENT Sheva is not a reduced vowel. In fact, it is NOT A VOWEL AT ALL
    * <u>Any</u> letter, including Gutturals, can take a Silent Sheva
    * Silent/No sound
* We will learn how to distinguish between the two kinds of Sheva in the next lesson

Type | Class | Hebrew | Name | Pronunciation
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: 
Reduced | No Class | <span class="he">בְּ</span> | Vocal Sheva | amuse

The Sof Pasuq

* It is worth pointing out that in Hebrew Bibles, we may come across a mark that looks like a super-sized Sheva
* In English, we might say it looks like a giant colon mark (:)
* In Hebrew, this mark is called a Sof Pasuq, and it is used to mark the end of the verse
* Other than this, the mark has no meaning for us whatsoever.  You may ignore it when you encounter it, except that you will know that it always marks the end of a verse.

### Vowel letters use a consonant plus a nikkud to form a vowel {-}



* Shureq is pronounced like Qibbuts (r<u>u</u>ler)
* Hireq Yod is pronounced like the i in mach<u>i</u>ne (compared to Hireq (Short I), which is pronounced like "b<u>i</u>tter)
* The other vowel letters are pronounced like the corresponding vowel - Qamets Hei is pronounced like Qamets, and so forth
* All vowel letters, except Seghol Hei, are LONG
* Yod and Vav vowels - י,ו 
    * Not only are these Long vowels, they have a unique feature is that they are "immune" from "propretonic reduction"
    * Therefore they are called "Unchangeable long vowels" or sometimes "Irreducible long vowels"
    * We'll explain what this means in the next lesson
* Hei Vowels - ה
    * Hei vowels can **ONLY** occur at the END of a word
    * Hei vowels are extremely common in Hebrew
    * The Hei vowels are Long (except for Seghol Hei) but they are not labeled as irreducible/unchangeable^[Strictly speaking, this point is irrelevant as a vowel at the end of a word would never reduce anyway. But, if you are ever asked "are the Hei vowels irreducible/unchangeable?", the answer is "no."]

::: {.box .caution}
* Do not confuse "vowel reducing" with "defective spelling"
* Although unchangable long vowels CANNOT reduce, they CAN be written defectively
  * For example, what was originally <span class="he">בּוֹ</span> becomes <span class="he">בֹּ</span>
* We will discuss defective spelling next

In "defective" spelling, letter vowels can sometimes drop their letter and take on the corresponding non-letter vowel. The meaning of the word does not change.

This is the word for "laws" showing both "plene" spelling and "defective" spelling.  Both spellings mean exactly the same thing: "laws" or "teachings".

```{r, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/defective.gif")
```

* Vowel letters commonly take "defective" forms^["Defective", in this sense, does not have a negative connotation.]
* Holem-Vav can drop the Vav and contract to Holem, as in the example above
* Hireq-Yod can drop the Yod and contract to Hireq
* Shuruq can drop entirely and contract to Qibbuts - this sometimes catches students by surprise - see caution box below.
* The Qamets-Hei <span class="he">ה ָ  </span>sometimes drops the final ה, leaving just the Qamets under the now-final letter.

::: {.box .caution}
An unchangeable long vowel written defectively is still an unchangeable long vowel


* A Qibbuts that is _not_ defective is a short vowel
* A Qibbuts that is a defective Shureq is an unchangeable long vowel

For now, do not be concerned about the difference.  As we progress in the course, you will see this in action.
:::

::: {.infobox .info}    
If any of this is confusing now, as we've said before, hang in there!  As you progress in your knowledge of Hebrew, you’ll start to develop a mental checklist when you encounter something that does not seem to follow the regular rules. Asking yourself, “Could this be a defective spelling?” will be one of those checklist items.

* Most Hebrew grammar books include transliteration values
* While learning the transliteration scheme can help in some instances, our general position is that it can be an unnecessary distraction
* Where it can be useful is as shorthand
  * It would get wordy to write "Holem Vav" repeatedly
  * It's much less clutter to write the shorthand version based on transliteration: $\hat O$
  * Often, the vowel marks in isolation can be difficult to detect; compare ֹ  with $\hat O$
* As we move forward in the course, particularly in unit three, we will be making use of the vowel shorthand listed below

::: {.box .info}

* Short Vowels (no marking): $A$ for Patach, $E$ for Seghol, $I$, Hireq, $O$ for Qamets Hatuf, and $U$, Qibbuts
* Long Vowels that are not letters (bar): $\bar A$ for Qamets, $\bar E$ for Tsere, and $\bar O$ for Holem
* Reduced Vowels (breve): $\breve A$ for Hateph Patach, $\breve E$ for Hateph Seghol, $\breve O$ = Hateph Qamets Hatuf
* Vowel letters (hat): $\hat E$ = Tsere+Yod^[Formal shorthand for Tsere+Hei, Seghol+Hei, and Seghol+Yod is also $\hat E$ but for this course, we will only use $\hat E$ for Tsere+Yod.], $\hat I$ = Hireq+Yod; $\hat O$ = Holem+Vav^[Formal shorthand for Holem+Hei is also $\hat O$ but for this course, we will only use $\hat O$ for Holem+Vav.], $\hat U$ = Shureq, and Qamets+Hei = $\hat A$^[Formal shorthand for Qamets+Yod is also $\hat A$ but for this course, we will only use $\hat A$ for Qamets+Hei.]
* Additionally, we have  Vocal Sheva = $ə$, and $:$ for Silent Sheva^[Vocal Sheva has a "hurried" pronunciation, like the _a_ in _amuse_ or _Tina_. ə is the [international character for this sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel){target="_blank"}. Silent Sheva has no pronunciation transliteration value.]

:::

* We will use this shorthand frequently when we discuss verbs
* We will review the values again as we get into Unit 3

* Notice the dot in the שּׁ in <span class="he">הַשָּׁמַיִם:</span>
  * The dot is called a Dagesh FORTE - it is the Dagesh Lene's big brother
  * Since שׁ is not a בגד כפת letter, we know this *cannot* be a Dagesh Lene
* The letter with the Dagesh Forte both ends one syllable and begins the next syllable - in fact, a way to think of the Daghesh Forte is to call it the "doubling Daghesh"
* In <span class="he">הַשָּׁמַיִם:</span> is pronounced: `hash-sha-mayim`^[ `Mayim` is one syllable as we will learn in Lesson 3.  <span class="he">הַשָּׁמַיִם</span> means "the heavens."  From now on, we won't always provide a translation for every new word you encounter.  It's more important that you focus on the concepts.  You will have PLENTY of vocabulary work in Anki!]
* A similar word in English might be better = bet | ter
    * If we were to transliterate better into Hebrew hypothetically,  it might look like: בּטֶּר*^[The * means this is not a real Hebrew word, but we show it in this form for illustration.]

* Any consonant (except for Gutturals and Resh) can take a Dagesh Forte, including a בגד כפת letter
    * The "Buck-up" letters will take the **hard** pronunciation regardless of a Dagesh Lene or Dagesh Forte - See the final word אַתָּה in the previous section

_Advanced tip:_ When you see a Dagesh Forte, it often means that another letter has disappeared^[Not entirely unlike the English apostrophe in words like _can't_.].  We will talk more about this later in the course.

::: {.infobox .info}
It's good to think of the Dagesh Forte as the "Doubling Dagesh" since it doubles the consonant and often changes a word's meaning.  

Conversely, we can think of the Dagesh Lene as the "Meaningless Dagesh" since it does not ever change a word's meaning

So how do you tell whether a Daghesh in a בגד כפת letter is Lene or Forte?

::: {.infobox .light} 
A Dagesh is a Forte if, and only if, it's preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva^[Remember we said in the introduction that content in "light" information boxes should usually be memorized.  You will definitely want to memorize the Dagesh Forte rule.]
:::

That's it.  That's the rule^[Strictly speaking, there are exceptions.  We only have one in this course and we won't see it until Unit 4.].  

Quiz yourself with these examples (answers below):


* <span class="he">אַתָּה</span> = Is the Dagesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?^[Yes, a patach. Dagesh Forte]
* <span class="he">בְּרֵאשִׁית</span> = Is the Dagesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?^[No. Dagesh Lene]
* <span class="he">עַל־פְּנֵי</span> = Is the Dagesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?^[No. Dagesh Lene.  The "hyphen" looking mark is called a Maqquef.  It has the same function as the Hyphen does in English.]
* <span class="he">מַבְדִּיל</span> = Is the Dagesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?^[No, it is preceded by a Sheva. Dagesh Lene.]
* <span class="he">מִתַּחַת</span>  = Is the Dagesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?^[Yes, a Hiriq. Dagesh Forte]

:::

*   When a Vav has a Dagesh Forte, it looks like this וּ and, therefore, is identical to a Shureq וּ
*   It's surprisingly easy to tell the difference
*   A Shureq will _never_ have a separate vowel following or preceding
*   If the preceding consonant has a vowel, the וּ is a Vav with a Dagesh - that's the rule we just learned
*   Also, if there is an additional vowel either under or over the same letter, it can't be a Shureq as there are never two vowels in a row (and there is no diphthong involving a Shureq)
* Examples:
  * <span class="he">בוּ</span> = Shureq
  * <span class="he">בְוָּ</span> = Vav with Dagesh Forte - a Shureq would never take an additional vowel
  * <span class="he">בָוּ</span> = Vav with Dagesh Forte ־ the Rule of Sheva:  preceding letter has a vowel 
  * The last example is hypothetical only; generally, a Vav with the Dagesh Forte would have both a preceding vowel/Sheva AND an additional vowel/Sheva
  
::: {.box .info}

When you see <span class="he">וּ</span>, it is usually a Shureq

:::

* A similar situation happens with <span class="he">וֹ</span>
  * Consider the word, <span class="he>מִצְוֹת</span>
    * This is a consonantal Vav with a Holem, pronounced "vo"
    * The previous consonant has a Sheva ending the syllable; the next syllable cannot start with a vowel

* We said in Lesson One that the Gutturals don’t play nice with the other Hebrew Rules, and this rejection of the Dagesh Forte is one of those ways
* A Hebrew collision like this means something has to give. . . and the gutturals tend to get their way.
* It's like they have a force-field shielding them from other Hebrew grammar rules!

MAPPIQ

* You may see הּ. This dot is not a Dagesh because we just learned that gutturals never take a Dagesh but a Mappiq.
