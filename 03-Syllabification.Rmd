# Syllabification and Pronunciation {#Syllabification}

> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must know how syllables function


Originally, the Bible and other ancient documents, were written without spaces.  In addition to vowels, the ancient scribes and readers organically adopted a system of syllables and accents.  They knew where one word ended, and another began without needing to write it down.  

What we call "Hebrew grammar" is truly an exciting journey into the system of spoken and written Hebrew, which had its formation thousands of years ago!

**EQUIPMENT CHECK**

Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

* The vowels that are not letters, including their type (long, short, reduced) and class (a,e,i,o,u)
* The vowels that are letters, including which are the "irreducible long" type
* The difference between a Daghesh Forte and a Daghesh Lene
:::

**The authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> believe Lesson 3 could be the most challenging chapter in the book.** 

Suppose you do not have the vowels and, chiefly, the vowel types memorized. In that case, this chapter will be all the more difficult.

Assuming you've checked your equipment as directed above, and everything is in tip-top shape for your Lesson 3 adventure, take your time.  Work through the written material, then do a little Anki work and see if it starts to click. 

If not, then come back here and re-read the material again. Then go back to Anki.  If you find yourself getting frustrated, take a break, and come back to it later.  Continue to work through "the fog."

You absolutely must have the concepts from this lesson hard-wired before you continue to Lesson 4.  The good news is that once you get this lesson down, the ones that follow will be relatively straightforward.

In addition to all of these new concepts, the authors have also seen fit to introduce a full set of vocabulary words AND study verses beginning with Lesson 3.  So the overall workload will increase, starting with this lesson.

We're praying for you in advance as we compile this section!  Now, climb the mountain!



## First Thought {-}

###  אַשְׁרֵי אָדָם לֹא יַחְשֹׁב יְהוָה לוֹ  {-}

*How blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity  (Psalms 32:2)*

Thank God for his blessings and meditate upon them.

``` 

## Hebrew Syllables {#syllables}

There are two basic concepts when it comes to Hebrew Syllables:

::: {.infobox .light}

1. Every syllable begins with one consonant and has only one vowel
2. There are only open or closed syllables 

:::

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}

include_graphics("images/03.syllable.png")
```

We see the two basic concepts at play in this simple word (pronounced "da-var" and means word, matter, thing):

* The two syllables each begin with a consonant and have one vowel
    * דָּ starts with the consonant Dalet and has one vowel, Qamets
      * This is also an example of an "open" syllable - open syllables end with a _vowel_, not a consonant
    * בָר starts with the consonant Bet and has one vowel, also a Qamets
      * This is an example of a "closed" syllable - closed syllables end with a _consonant_, not a vowel 
* If you need to know how many syllables are in a Hebrew word, count the vowels
    * Remember that vowel letters, such as the Hiriq-Yod, and Diphthongs we will see later in this lesson, count as a single vowel unit

## Hebrew Word Accents {#accents}

::: {.infobox .light}
* Most frequently, Hebrew words are accented on the last syllable  
* If not, then the accent will be on the next-to-last syllable<small>^[<small>Later in the course, we will learn about a mark called a maqqef, which is like a hyphen in English.  In Hebrew, the word to the right of the maqqef technically does not have an accent.</small>]</small>
* Reduced vowels and Sheva never take an accent. If there is a word-final Sheva, the accent will be on the next-to-last syllable 
:::

Unlike English, Biblical Hebrew words are never stressed anywhere else<small>^[<small>Modern Hebrew has words (mostly borrowed from other languages) that don't always follow this rule</small>]</small>.

```{r, out.width = "500pt", fig.align='center'}

include_graphics("images/03.accent_stress.png")
```

* The word on the left is stressed on the last syllable
* The word on the right (pronounced "SAY-pher" and means book, scroll, or document) is stressed on the next to last syllable
    * Some texts will place a mark over the syllable to be stressed (except when it is on the last syllable)<small>^[<small>Hebrew has a very elaborate system of [cantillation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_cantillation){target="_blank"} that also serve to indicate where the accent of the word is. are used for chanting and singing.  A study of these marks is beyond the scope of this book.</small>]</small>

### Tonic, Pretonic, and Propretonic Syllables {-}

* We will encounter specific terms for a syllable's position respective to the word's accent
* Let's use the plural of דָּבָר to illustrate: דְּ ׀ בָ ׀ רִים
    * The **Propretonic** syllable is two (or more) steps away from the accent = דְּ
        * Notice how the vowel changed from the Qamets in דָּבָר to a Vocal Shewa in דְּבָרִים
        * This vowel shortening of the propretonic syllable is called _Propretonic Reduction_ and is extremely common in Hebrew
        * Qamets and Tsere will become Sheva (or hateph patach/hateph seghol)
    * The **Pretonic** Syllable is the syllable immediately before the accented syllable = בָ
    * The **Tonic** syllable is the one with the accent = רִים<small>^[<small) If there is a syllable AFTER the accented syllable, technically it is called "Posttonic," but you will not reencounter this term for the remainder of this course.  </small>]</small>
    
### Ultima, Penultima, and Antepenultima syllables {-}

Since the accent is not always in a fixed location, we sometimes will use other words that describes a syllable's position irrespective of the accent. 

  * _ultima_ = the last syllable
  * _penultima_ = the next to last syllable
  * _antepenultima_ = the syllable(s) before the _penultima_
  


## Rules for Silent Sheva {#s_sheva}

Learn the three rules for differentiating a SILENT Sheva from a Vocal Sheva:

### A Sheva is SILENT when the previous vowel is short: {-}

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.sheva-shortvowel.png")
```

### A Sheva is SILENT when the first of two consecutive Shevas _within a word_: {-}
```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.sheva-firstoftwo.png")
```

### A Sheva is SILENT when at the end of a word: {-}
```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.sheva-endofword.png")
```

## Rules for Vocal Sheva {#v_sheva}

Learn the four rules for differentiating a VOCAL Sheva from a Silent Sheva

### A Sheva is VOCAL when the initial Sheva in a word: {-}

```{r, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.sheva-initialvocal.png")
```

### A Sheva is VOCAL when the second of two consecutive Shevas _within a word_<small>^[<small>A Sheva at the **end** of a word is **always silent**, even when it is the second of two consecutive Shevas.</small>]</small>:  {-}

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.sheva-secondoftwovocal.png")
```


### A Sheva is VOCAL when under a Daghesh Forte: {-}

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.sheva-fortevocal.png")
```

### A Sheva is VOCAL after an unaccented long vowel: {-}

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.sheva-unaccentedlongvocal.png")
```

This one may seem random, but it is relatively common with _long_ vowels in a propretonic position<small>^[<small>These vowels often but do not always reduce (see section 3.6). Unchangeable long vowels will never reduce.</small>]</small>  The word above is not kōṯ-vim but kō-ṯᵉ-vîm.

## Hebrew Diphthong = Accented Patach-Yod-Hiriq {#diphthong}

```{r, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/03.diphthong.png")
```

::: {.infobox .light} 
The diphthong is a single vowel unit, which means it is only one syllable
:::

We do not pronounce as "BUY-it", but monosyllabic, like "BITE"<small>^[<small>With this said, "buy" it makes a handy mnemonic for remembering this word means 'house', as there are a few look-alike words.</small>]</small>; and not "sh-MAY-im" but it sounds more like "sh-MIME"

*****

Qamets-Yod-Vav is another Diphthong that you'll see in Lesson 9.  It's the pronoun suffix endings for "his" or "him". 

* אֵלָיו (to him) pronounced 'eLAV.
* פָּנָיו (his face) pronounced paNAV

There is scholarly disagreement as to whether (vowel)+Yod are vowel letters or diphthongs.  <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> treats them as vowel letters.




## Vowels and Syllable Preference {#vowel_pref}

```{r, out.width = "500pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.vowelpreferencetable.png")
```

This table may seem like minutiae, but do yourself a favor: memorize it, noting the following:

* *In an open pretonic syllable, Hebrew REQUIRES a long vowel.
* *In a closed unaccented syllable, Hebrew REQUIRES a short vowel.
* **Open/Propretonic _must_ reduce from a long vowel to Vocal Sheva (or Hateph if guttural), _except_ when there is an unchangeable long vowel
  * Go back and look at דָּבָר and דְּבָרִים
    * The vowel preference table explains why the vowel under the Dalet changes from Qamets in the open pretonic to Vocal Shewa (reduced vowel) in the open propretonic when the plural suffix "im" is added
    * This is called "_propretonic reduction_" - you will encounter this topic frequently.   
  * As we saw with כֹּתְבִים, uunchangeable long vowels written "defectively" will not reduce - at their essence, they are still unchangable.

## Qamets Hatuf, Furtive Patach, Quiescent Alef {#misc_vowels}

These are three miscellaneous but straightforward rules.

::: {.infobox .light} 
Qamets Hatuf ONLY occurs in a Closed AND Unaccented syllable

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.qametshatuf.png")
```
:::

There are many instances where the vowel could be a short qamets-hatuf vowel in a closed syllable, or the long Qamets, A-class vowel in an open syllable.  When this ambiguity occurs, many printings will print a vertical line called a meteg בָּֽ.  The meteg tells you the vowel is the **long, a-class**

```{r, out.width = "100pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.meteg.png")
```

*****

::: {.infobox .light} 
Furtive Patach under final ח or ע is said BEFORE the guttural letter and is not a full vowel

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/03.furtivepathach.png")
```
:::

The Furtive Patach is a significant exception to just about everything else we've discussed related to vowels and syllabification:
  * The vowel is pronounced *before* the guttural - so the above word is **Ruach** not "rucha"
  * The Furtive Patach is not a full vowel and is counted in syllabification - so the above word is **Ruach** not "ru-ach"

*****

::: {.infobox .light} 
Quiescent Aleph is silent, neither a consonant nor a vowel

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/03.quiescentaleph.png")
```
:::

* When you see an Aleph with no vowels, it is acting as a silent letter
    * English has all kinds of silent letters, like the 'p' in receipt - the Quiescent Aleph works the same way
    * In terms of syllabification, the Aleph is neither a vowel nor a consonant, so it doesn't count at all - it is just an extra letter
    
## Lesson Conclusion and Activities {-}

Congratulations on getting this far! We realize that there are a lot of heavy concepts you face in this Lesson.

Some of you may try to read this lesson then do the Anki work (perhaps repeated a few times), and you still aren't getting it.  The Fog isn't clearing.  If this is the case, and you want a more in-depth lecture covering this material, we recommend [Dr. John Beckman's hour-long YouTube Lecture on lesson 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY7KAsD4fZg&feature=youtu.be){target="_blank"}

For this lesson, we are introducing two new activities that correspond with the official launch of `Vocabulary` and `Study Verses` you will see in `Anki`.

### Introduction to Video Warm-ups {-}

* On the next two pages are videos of the vocabulary words and then the study verses
* Practice speaking the word/verses aloud, following along with Izzy 
* You may not know what the words mean yet, and that's fine (that's where Anki comes in)
* Consider this some "syllabic stretching" before you do your full Anki workout!

Then after watching these, go ahead and jump into `Anki`.

* `Lesson 03 A.Vocab` - This is our first lesson with the <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> vocabulary list.
* `Lesson 03 B.Grammar` - This module will reinforce and expand on the Seven Practical Points for this lesson.
* `Lesson 03 C.Verses`
  * This is also the verse lesson using the <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> study verses.
  * The translation may be difficult at first. It may take you several attempts before you can select `Good` without using the `Hints`.
  * Be patient and stick with it - you'll get it!

## `Ruth Pursuit` {-}        

### Your Quest: {-}

1. Identify all examples of the Tetragrammaton, which we pronounce "Adonai" when we encounter it in Scripture.  There are six instances of the Name. (Blue)
2. In verse 16, highlight, "עַמֵּךְ עַמִּי וֵאלֹהַיִךְ אֱלֹהָי" in green. This is the famous verse, "your people (will be) my people, and your God, my God."  One of your vocabulary words is אֱלֹהִים. In the last two words of what you just highlighted, you can still see the core portion of אֱלֹהִים present.  Begin to notice how Hebrew uses different suffixes to denote "your" and "my."
3. In verse 1, find one Sheva that begins a word and one Sheva that concludes a word.  Which one is a silent Sheva, and which one is the vocal Sheva?
4. Find the quiescent Aleph in verse 1 (pink)
5. Find the Hebrew words for Judah, Moab, and Bethlehem in Verse 1. (gray).  Bethlehem is two separate words in Hebrew. The first word has a single-letter preposition (מ) that means "from."
6. For personal reflection, open an English translation side-by-side with your Hebrew version of Ruth 1.  Note how the foreigner Ruth uses both אֱלֹהִים and the Tetragrammaton in verses 16 and 17, respectively.  Why do you think this might be? Would you say the names are used interchangeably, or do you think there is a deeper purpose?  May we always seek HIM, just as you have done in this activity!
