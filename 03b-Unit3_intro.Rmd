# (PART) Nouns, Prepositions, Pronouns {-}

# Introduction to Unit 2 {-}

* In Unit 1, we covered the foundational elements of Hebrew 
    * Consonants
    * Vowels, Sheva, and Dagesh Forte
    * Syllabification
* Now in Unit 2, we will use those building blocks from Unit 1 to form nouns, prepositions, and adjectives
* Units 3 and 4 we will transition to verbs

## Changes for Unit 2 {-}

* If you recall from the Introduction, we described Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, Lessons 4-35 as the expanded edition of the _Hebrew Quest_ grammar overview lessons (13-15)
* For Unit 2, each lesson will have one (sometimes more than one) clip from Lesson 13 of _Hebrew Quest_
