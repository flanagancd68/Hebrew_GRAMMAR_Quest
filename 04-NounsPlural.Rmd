# Hebrew Nouns {.Nouns}



> In order to comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must understand how nouns are formed, how they are pluralized, and how to look words up in a dictionary.


Nouns consist of a person, place, thing, or idea and can be singular or plural.  Hebrew also introduces the concept of "gender".  In this lesson we will review aspects of the Hebrew noun with specific attention focused on the rules of pluralization.

**LESSON ITINERARY**

1. Understand Noun Gender and Number
2. Examine singular noun endings and "endingless" nouns for both Masculine and Feminine nouns
3. Examine endings for plural and dual nouns
4. Identify special dual forms
6. Examine other/irregular Pluralization
7. Describe the Rule of Sheva
1. Define what is meant by "Lexical Form"
:::

EQUIPMENT CHECK

Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

* Vowel and syllable preference
* The rules for Silent Sheva and Vocal Sheva
:::

Additionally, starting with this lesson we will invoke the shorthand we've been learning in Anki (e.g. MP = Masculine Plural, FS = Feminine singular).


**Parsing vs Inflecting:** Many Hebrew grammar books expect students to know how to pluralize nouns in writing. This is called inflecting.  Inflecting is when we take a base word and do something with it, such as change its gender or number.  When those books get to verbs, they spend a lot of effort focused on taking a base verb and inflecting it into all the different forms (person, gender, number, active, passive, reflexive, and so forth).  _Parsing_ is somewhat of the opposite concept where you take an inflected word and break it down into its base form.

Reading the Hebrew Bible does not require you to inflect a noun or a verb; however, reading the Bible **does** require you to parse a word. 

This is so that you are able identify the lexical form and understand what the word means means (or if you don't know what it means, how to look it up in a dictionary).

Our objective with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is only that you know how to parse words. Beginning with this lesson you will see an `Anki` chapter called `Workbook`, which will have some activities like parsing. The ability to inflect **IS** a great skill to have to master the language.  If you wish to dig deeper and get into inflecting, we encourage you to check out <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> or another suitable textbook or workbook.

## Gender and Number {#gender_number}

All Hebrew nouns have Gender and Number. 

* Gender
    * The "gender" sometimes does, but usually does not, have anything to do with biologic gender.  
    * <span class="he">סֵ֫פֶר</span> is masculine (M), while <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span>  is feminine (F). There is nothing inherently masculine about books nor feminine about laws or instructions
    * The gender of a noun never changes
    
* Number
    * A noun is either singular (S), plural (P), or less frequently, dual (D)
        * Dual is exactly two of something
        * Apart from the words "pair" or "both", English doesn't have too many dual forms
        * In Hebrew, typically paired body parts are in the dual form
    * The number of a noun CAN change
    * A word's ending indicates the number
    
Verbs, will introduce "person".  Collectively, when you see "PGN" in grammar, this refers to "person, gender, number"; e.g. "3MS" means "3rd person, masculine, singualr".

## Singular Noun Endings {#sing_noun_endings}

* Singular
    * Masculine singular (MS): generally are "endingless" (but all MS are endingless and not all endingless are MS); occasionally a MS noun may end in (accented) <span class="he">ה ֶ֫</span>
    * The following words are examples of FS endings:
        * <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span> (Most common)
        * <span class="he">בַּת</span> 
        * <span class="he">תִּפְאֶ֫רֶת</span>  (glory)
        * <span class="he">בְּרִית</span> (covenant)
        * <span class="he">מַלְכּוּת</span> (kingdom)
        * <span class="he">אֶ֫רֶץ</span> (land - endingless, but feminine - less common)<small>^[<small>Not all endingless nouns are MS.  Some common words are endingless but are classified as FS: <span class="he">אֶ֫רֶץ</span> (land), <span class="he">עִיר</span> (city), and <span class="he">אֶ֫בֶן</span> (stone). When this occurs, most vocabulary lists will mark the word as "(F)".</small>]</small>
        
::: {.box .info}
Some students fall into a habit of thinking every word-final ה is feminine.  Remember <span class="he">ה ֶ֫</span>  is masculine
:::

## Plural Noun Endings {#noun_pluralization}

For regular nouns, simply remove the singular ending if there is one, and add the plural ending.

* Plural endings:
    * MP: <span class="he">ים ִ</span> e.g. **<span class="he">סוּסִים</span>** 
        * <span class="he">דָּבָר</span> becomes **<span class="he">דְּבָרִים</span>**
            * A vowel under a non-Guttural will reduce to Vocal Shewa -<span class="he"> דְּבָרִים</span>
            * As we saw in Lesson 3.2,<span class="he"> דְּבָרִים</span> changes from <span class="he">דָבָר </span>because an open propretonic syllable prefers a reduced vowel. 
        * <span class="he">עָנָן</span> becomes **<span class="he">עֲנָנִים</span>** (clouds)
            *  A vowel under a guttural will take a Hateph vowel, usually Hateph Patach - <span class="he">עֲנָנִים</span>
        * <span class="he">כּוֹכָב</span> becomes **<span class="he">כּוֹכָבִים</span>**
            *  An irreducible long vowel will not reduce - <span class="he">כּוֹכָבִים</span> 
    * FP: <span class="he">וֹת</span> e.g. **<span class="he">מְלָכוֹת</span>** (queens)
        * <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span> becomes **<span class="he">תּוֹרוֹת</span>** 

Under the MP endings above, note the propretonic reduction when the original word is more the one syllable. 

## Dual Noun Endings

* MD: <span class="he">יִם ַ</span> e.g. <span class="he">סוּסַ֫יִם</span> (two horses)
* FD: <span class="he">יִם ַ </span> e.g., <span class="he">יָדַ֫יִם</span> (two hands) or <span class="he">תַ֫יִם ָ</span> as in <span class="he">תּוֹרָתַ֫יִם</span> (two laws).

Occasionally, we will see defective spelling of the plural and dual endings: <span class="he">סוּסִם תּוֹרֹת</span>


## Special dual forms {#dual_forms}

Hebrew has three common words that have the dual ending but are usually translated as singular.

* <span class="he">שַׁמַ֫יִם</span> heaven, sky (sometimes "heavens")
* <span class="he">מִצְרַ֫יִם</span> Egypt
* <span class="he">מַ֫יִם</span> water (sometimes "waters")
* <span class="he">פָּנִים</span> face


## Irregular Pluralization  {#irregular_pluralization}

* Hebrew does have a handful of irregular nouns.  
* For example you won't find <span class="he">נִשִׁים</span> in a dictionary. 
* You need to know the singular form, <span class="he">אִשָּׁה</span>
* Rather than a detailed discussion on what is going on with the plural forms (and honestly, scholars don't really know why a word like <span class="he">אָבוֹת</span> looks like a feminine word), it's easier to memorize these eight most common pairs:

| S   | Def      | P     | Def.      |
|:-----|:----------|:-------|:-----------|
|<span class="he"> אִישׁ </span>| man      | <span class="he">אֲנָשִׁים</span> | men       |
|<span class="he"> אִשָּׁה </span>| woman    | <span class="he">נָשִׁים</span>  | women     |
|<span class="he"> עִיר </span>| city     | <span class="he">עָרִים </span> | cities    |
|<span class="he"> אָב </span> | father   | <span class="he">אָבוֹת </span> | fathers   |
|<span class="he"> בַּ֫יִת</span> | house    | <span class="he">בָּתִּים </span> | houses    |
|<span class="he"> בַּת</span>  | daughter | <span class="he">בָּנוֹת </span> | daughters |
|<span class="he"> בֵּן</span>  | son      | <span class="he">בָּנִים </span> | sons      |
|<span class="he"> יוֹם</span> | day      | <span class="he">יָמִים </span> | day       |

* The plural forms retain the gender of their singular noun
* <span class="he">אָבוֹת</span> is still masculine,  and <span class="he">נָשִׁים</span> is still feminine, despite the plural endings.

::: {.box .info}

When you see an _internal_ (not word-final) tsere+yod, as in<span class="he"> בָּתִּים</span>, the vowel pattern in the 'original' word was likely the accented-patach-yod-hiriq diphthong, as in <span class="he">בַּ֫יִת</span>.
:::

The next two categories of irregular words are more straightforward:

### Segholate Nouns follow a standard vowel pattern when pluralizing {-}

* Did you notice that the words, <span class="he">דֶּ֫רֶךְ</span>  and <span class="he">סֵ֫פֶר</span> have the accent is on the first syllable?
* Many two syllable words accented on the penult are classified as _Segholate_ nouns.  
* They get this name because frequently, though not always, there are two Seghol vowels. <span class="he">נַ֫עַר</span>  (boy, youth) is a segholate noun even though it doesn't have any Seghol vowels.

::: {.box .info}
If a plural word has Vocal Sheva/Hateph under the first consonant and Qamets under the second, with the normal MP or FP ending, the word is likely a Segholate noun.
:::

* <span class="he">מֶ֫לֶךְ</span> to <span class="he">מְלָכִים</span>
* <span class="he">סֵ֫פֶר</span> to <span class="he">סְפָרִים</span>
* <span class="he">נַ֫עַר</span> to <span class="he">נְעָרִים</span>

### Geminate words take a Daghesh Forte {-}

_Geminate_ (from the Latin for "twins") words appear to have two visible letters (which we call "biconsonantal"), but at one point the second consonant appeared twice.  Example <span class="he">עַם</span> (people) was once *<span class="he">עמם</span>.
The lexical form drops the extra consonant.

::: {.box .info}
When we pluralize a Geminate word, the "twin" letter "reappears" but as a Daghesh Forte instead of a consonant.  So in our example,<span class="he"> עַם</span> becomes <span class="he">עַמִּים</span> (peoples).
:::

The reason we don't have a Daghesh Forte in עַם is that **the last consonant of a word rejects the Daghesh Forte when it has no vowel.**

## Rule of Sheva {#rules_sheva}

Sometimes, according to other rules of grammar, we end up with a scenario where we have two reduced vowels, such as two vocal sheva, back to back.  However, an overarching facet of Hebrew is that two reduced vowels in a row cannot stand.  

::: {.box .light}
The Rule of Sheva changes the first of two reduced vowels into the corresponding short vowel.
The first of two contiguous Vocal Sheva will usually change to a Hireq.  
:::

* Note the unique situation when the second consonant is a Yod:

```{r, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/04.vocal_vocal_hireq.png")
```

These next two could be called "Hateph copy-cat" rules.  Notice how the vowel under the first consonant in all six examples takes on the short-vowel equivalent of the hateph vowel:

* A hateph vowel under a "G"uttural that is followed by a Vocal Sheva will change to the short vowel in the same class (e.g. hateph patach to patach)
```{r, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/04.hateph_vocal_shift.png")
```
* A Vocal Sheva that is followed by a hateph vowel will change to the short-vowel in the same class as the hateph vowel.  
```{r, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/04.vocal_hateph_shift.png")
```
When a prefix is added to <span class="he">אלֹהִים</span>. and the Tetragramaton the vowel changes are irregular:

* With <span class="he">אלֹהִים</span> the aleph becomes quiescent after a prefix:
    * <span class="he">אלֹהִים + לְ = לֵאלֹהִים</span>
* With the Tetragramaton, the prefixed letter with take a Patach, with nothing under the Yod:
    *  <span class="he">בַיהוָה</span>


To flip around the Rule of Sheva, suppose as you are reading, you encounter a syllable that begins with a _short_ vowel followed by a reduced vowel.  In that case, you may be looking at a grammatical scenario where there were originally been two reduced vowels.

You may be wondering why you need to know this.  Understanding that a syllable may have "originally" had a reduced vowel is an important clue when it comes to translating and parsing.  If you're 'foggy' now, hang in there.  It will make sense in a bit!


## Lexical Form {#lexical_form}

The Lexical Form is the dictionary version of the word.

English examples:
* "Oxen" may not be its own entry, but you would find it under "Ox"
* You may not find "went", but you would find "go"

Hebrew dictionaries (called "Lexicons" in academia) work the same way.

For nouns, the Lexical Form is the SINGULAR version of the noun.  Below is how to go from a plural noun to the singular, Lexical form (assuming you didn't already know the singular Lexical Form):

1. Drop the plural or dual ending
2. Perhaps add a singular ending
3. For Geiminate nouns, drop the Dagesh Forte when it lacks a vowel
4. Often change vowels if no singular ending - reduced vowels often become regular vowels but vowel letters do not change

## `Anki` {-}

* `Lesson 04 A. Vocab`
* `Lesson 04 B. Grammar` 
* `Lesson 04 C. Workbook` 
    * With Lesson 4, we are gradually increasing the depth of work in `Anki`
    * The `Workbook` will have short activities such as translation examples of concepts taught in the lesson and word "parsing"
    * When we parse a Hebrew word, we identify three things:
        * the Person (if applicable), Number and Gender of the word
        * the Lexical form
        * the definition of the original word
    * For example if the instruction is to parse <span class="he">שִׁירִים</span>  , we would respond with: "MP שִׁיר  Songs"
    * You may not know every word -
        * **That is the point of this exercise!**  
        * As you read your Hebrew Bible, you will invariably come across words you don't know.  
        * You will need to be able to break down a word into its Lexical form so you can look it up
        * In the [appendix](#lexicon), we have links to some lexicons (dictionaries) you may use with this course.  You can download an abridged version [here](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"} 
    * As we continue to advance, future lessons will incorporate additional aspects into our parsing activities such as verb conjugation.
* `Lesson 04 D. Study Verses`
    * We will continue with study verses that provide examples of the Lesson's vocabulary
    * Hints will be provided for less familiar verbs

## `Ruth Pursuit` {-}        

### Your Quest: {-}

1. find one regular singular segholate noun in V1.  In this verse there is also a segholate noun with a propositional prefix that we haven't studied yet; this world also takes on vowel changes but we'll cover that in a few lessons. (yellow)
2. find a regular masculine plural in v1 - This work has the definite article, which we will cover in the next lesson.  Also find a regular Feminine plural in vs 1-4 (pink).  What do you think the Lexical Form of this feminine word is?
3. find an irregular plural somewhere in vs 2-6 (green)
4. find an example of the "Rule of Sheva" in verses 10-13 (blue)
