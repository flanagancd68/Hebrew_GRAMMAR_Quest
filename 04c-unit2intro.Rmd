Congratulations again on completing unit 1!

* In Unit 1, we covered the foundational elements of Hebrew 
    * Consonants
    * Vowels, Sheva, and Dagesh Forte
    * Syllabification
    * Make sure you are relatively comfortable with these concepts before moving on to Unit 2 (and if you've been keeping up with your Anki work, this should be no problem for you!)
* Now in Unit 2, we will use those building blocks from Unit 1 to form nouns, prepositions, and adjectives
* In units 3 and 4, we will transition to verbs

<large>Changes for Unit 2</large>:

* _Hebrew Quest_ Videos
    * If you recall from the Introduction, we described Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, Lessons 4-35 as the expanded edition of the original _Hebrew Quest_ grammar overview lessons (13-15) - you are now about to embark on that expanded edition!
    * For Unit 2, each lesson will have one (sometimes more than one) clip from the grammar lessons of _Hebrew Quest_
    * You can ignore any references Izzy makes to the "Hebrew Quest Student Manual" or the "Essentials of Biblical Hebrew" book
    * As we talked about in the Lesson 3`Word Warm-up` video, you can speed up or slow down the video speed by clicking the gear icon, then changing the `Playback Speed`
* `Anki` Workbook modules
    * Many grammar textbooks have accompanying workbooks that give students additional practice
    * While it is reasonable to think of `Anki` as one giant workbook, beginning with Unit 2 we are adding in a `workbook` chapter where we will begin to dissect words or short passages
    * Our goal is to `parse` and `translate`
        * `Parsing` is identifying the gender, number, person (if applicable), and the lexical form
        * `Translating` is identifying the word's meaning

Now, if you're ready, let's begin our Unit 2 Quest!
