> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must understand how nouns are formed, how they are pluralized, and how to look words up in a dictionary.  Often, we need to employ the Rule of Sheva to help us identify the dictionary form of a word.


Nouns consist of a person, place, thing, or idea and can be singular, dual or plural.  Hebrew also introduces the concept of "gender."  This lesson will review aspects of the Hebrew noun with specific attention focused on pluralization rules.

We will also learn the Rule of Sheva, which is responsible for the most common spelling variations in the Hebrew Bible

::: {.infobox .map}
**LESSON ITINERARY**

1. Understand a Noun's gender and number
1. Define what is meant by "lexical form"
2. Examine singular noun endings and "endingless" nouns for both masculine and feminine nouns
3. Examine endings for plural and dual nouns
4. Identify special dual forms
6. Examine other/irregular Pluralization
7. Describe the Rule of Sheva

:::

::: {.infobox .stop}
EQUIPMENT CHECK

Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

* Vowel and syllable preference table memorized
* The rules for Silent Sheva vs. Vocal Sheva
    * Which is the second of two consecutive Sheva, except at the end of a word?
        * <div class="fold">Vocal</div>
    * Which is the first of two consecutive Sheva, except at the beginning of a word?
        * <div class="fold">Silent</div>
    * Which is a Sheva under the first letter in a word?
        * <div class="fold">Vocal</div>
    * Which is a Sheva under the last letter in a word?
        * <div class="fold">Silent</div>

View this 10:37 overview video from _Hebrew Quest_, then we will dig into the concepts in greater detail as we progress through the lesson^[As we mentioned in the Unit 2 introduction, you can disregard references to the "Hebrew Quest Student Manual" or "Essentials of Biblical Hebrew."  Pertinent concepts have been incorporated into Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest]. We will be studying the "Construct Form" in Lesson 10.

* All Hebrew nouns have Gender and Number
* Grammatical Gender
    * The "gender" sometimes does, but usually does not have anything to do with biological gender
    * <span class="he">סֵ֫פֶר</span> is masculine (M), while <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span>  is feminine (F). There is nothing inherently masculine about books, nor is there anything feminine about laws or instructions
    * The gender of a noun never changes
* Number
    * A noun is either singular (S), plural (P), or less frequently, dual (D)
        * Dual is precisely two of something
        * Apart from the words "pair" or "both", English doesn't have too many dual forms
        * In Hebrew, typically paired body parts are in the dual form (eyes, ears)^[Only a limited number of words are dual.  Just because there may only be two of something does not necessarily mean we use the dual form.]
    * The number of a noun CAN change
* A word's ending can indicate both the NUMBER and the GENDER - we will learn the endings later in this lesson
    
::: {.box .info}
Person
    
* In Lesson 8, (Pronouns) we will introduce the concept of "person"  
* Collectively, when you see "PGN" in grammar, this refers to "person, gender, and number"; e.g., "3MS" means "3rd person, masculine, singular".

The Lexical Form is the dictionary version of the word.
:::

* English examples:
    * "Oxen" may not be its own entry, but you would find it under "ox"
    * You may not find "went," but you would find "go"
* Hebrew dictionaries (called "Lexicons" in academia) work the same way
    * For nouns, the Lexical Form is the SINGULAR version of the noun
    * For verbs, the Lexical Form is (usually) the PERFECT 3ms form of the verb^[So in a typical Hebrew Lexicon, you wouldn't actually find the meaning of the equivalent of "to go" under "go"; you _would_ find it under the equivalent of "(he) went"]

* When we take a base word and do something with it, such as change its gender or number, we call that _inflecting_ the word
    * For example, say you had the English word `mouse`.  The word `mice` would be inflecting `mouse` into its plural form
    * In this course, inflecting is kept to a minimum.  
    * Reading the Hebrew Bible never requires this skill^[Since inflecting can helpful when learning about verb forms, some of the Unit III `Ruth Pursuit` activities will involve a small amount of inflecting]

> _Parsing_ is somewhat of the opposite concept where we take an inflected word and break it down into its base form to determine its meaning

* For example, let's say you had the English word `mice`, you didn't know what it meant and needed to look it up.  
    * Let's further assume there was no dictionary entry for `mice` (Hebrew dictionaries often do not have separate entries for a word's plural forms).  
    * You would need to PARSE it = `Mice` is the plural form of `mouse.` In other words, `mice` is two or more of whatever a `mouse` is.
    * You could then look up `mouse` and be on your way
    * Reading the Hebrew Bible **does** require us to _parse_

> When we parse a word, we identify the lexical form and the inflected person, gender, and number to understand what the word is communicating to us

* We also have identified the lexical form so we can look it up in a dictionary
* Beginning with this lesson, you will see an `Anki` chapter called `Workbook`, which will have some activities like parsing

> A noun's ending, or lack of one, indicates NUMBER and (usually) GENDER

* Masculine singular (MS)
    * MS are usually "endingless" 
        * This means, most often, there is no special identifying ending to let you know it is a masculine singular word
        * Usually the absence of a Feminine, Dual, or Plural ending is enough to let you know you are looking at an MS word
    * Occasionally an MS noun may end in (accented) <span class="he">ה ֶ֫  </span> - for example <span class="he">שָֹדֶה</span> means "field"
* Feminine Singular (FS):
    * <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span> (the (accented) <span class="he">ה ָ   </span> ending is most typical)
    * Nouns that end in ($E, A, \bar A, or \ \hat U$)^[Remember this is shorthand for Tsere, Patach, Qamets and Shurek respectively. When we say something like "Qamets+Hei, we mean a Qamets under the preceding consonant followed by ה] + <span class="he">ת</span> (excluding the Feminine plural ending <span class="he">וֹת</span>) are _usually_ FS
        * <span class="he">בַּת</span> (daughter)
        * <span class="he">תִּפְאֶ֫רֶת</span>  (glory)
        * <span class="he">בְּרִית</span> (covenant)
        * <span class="he">מַלְכּוּת</span> (kingdom)
    * Some feminine words are also endingless: <span class="he">אֶ֫רֶץ</span> (land)
        * Other common words are FS endingless: 
            * <span class="he">עִיר</span> (city), 
            * <span class="he">אֶ֫בֶן</span> (stone)
            * Many vocabulary lists will mark an endingless feminine word as "(F)"
        
::: {.box .caution}
Some students fall into a habit of thinking every word-final<span class="he"> ה </span>is feminine.  
:::

* <span class="he">ה ֶ֫  </span>  is masculine
* UNACCENTED <span class="he">ה ָ   </span> is NOT the FS ending

> Plural noun endings are straightforward: <span class="he">ים ִ </span> and <span class="he">וֹת</span>; expect Propretonic Reduction if the resulting word now has a propretonic syllable

* MP - <span class="he">ים ִ </span> 
    * Since most MS nouns are endingless, simply affix the MP ending <span class="he">ים ִ</span>, e.g.<span class="he">סוֹס </span> (horse) becomes **<span class="he">סוּסִים</span>** (horses) 
    * <span class="he">דָּבָר</span> becomes **<span class="he">דְּבָרִים</span>**
        * A one-syllable ending affixed to a two syllable word, now is a three-syllable word and therefore, has a propretonic syllable
        * A vowel under a non-Guttural will reduce to Vocal Shewa -<span class="he"> דְּבָרִים</span>
        * As we saw in Lesson 3.2,<span class="he"> דְּבָרִים</span> changes from <span class="he">דָבָר </span>because an open propretonic syllable prefers a reduced vowel. 
    * <span class="he">עָנָן</span> becomes **<span class="he">עֲנָנִים</span>** (clouds)
        *  A vowel under a guttural will take a Hateph vowel, usually Hateph Patach - <span class="he">עֲנָנִים</span>
    * <span class="he">כּוֹכָב</span> becomes **<span class="he">כּוֹכָבִים</span>** (stars)
        *  An irreducible long vowel will not reduce - so in <span class="he">כּוֹכָבִים</span>, the $\hat O$ (Holem Vav) remains
    * Under the MP endings above, note the propretonic reduction when the original word is more the one syllable. 
* FP: <span class="he">וֹת</span>, e.g., **<span class="he">מְלָכוֹת</span>** (queens)
    * <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span> becomes **<span class="he">תּוֹרוֹת</span>**

When we get to verbs, we will find that <span class="he">וֹת</span> has other uses besides the FP ending

::: {.box .caution}
CAUTIONARY NOTES:

1. Occasionally, we will see the defective spelling of the plural and dual endings: <span class="he">סוּסִם תּוֹרֹת</span>; the gender and number of the word will not change.
2. The dual ending is not necessarily used every time there are are exactly two units of the noun in question.  Most commonly, we see the dual ending for paired body parts.

_Geminate_ (from the Latin for "twins") words appear to have two visible letters.  At one point in history, the second consonant appeared twice.  Example <span class="he">עַם</span> (people) was once *<span class="he">עמם</span>.  The lexical form drops the extra consonant.

::: {.box .info}
When we pluralize a Geminate word, the "twin" letter "reappears" but as a Dagesh Forte instead of a consonant.  So in our example,<span class="he"> עַם</span> becomes <span class="he">עַמִּים</span> (peoples).
:::

::: {.box .light}
* The reason we don't have a Dagesh Forte in עַם is that **a "word-final" letter (i.e. the last consonant of a word) ALWAYS rejects the Dagesh Forte when it has no vowel**
:::

* This is the second of three major scenarios where a Dagesh Forte is rejected
* We looked at the first scenario in Lesson 2 - Gutturals and Resh ALWAYS reject the Dagesh Forte
* There is one more rejection scenario that we will meet in Lesson 5

* As we mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, to understand the Hebrew Bible, you WON'T need to know how to take a singular word and make it plural

> You WILL need to know how to take a plural word and identify its singular counterpart

* Below is how to go from a plural noun to the singular, lexical form (assuming you didn't already know the singular Lexical Form):
    1. Remove the plural or dual ending
    2. Perhaps add a Feminine Singular ending (usually ה ָ ), or less frequently, ה ֶ for Masculine Singular
    3. For Geminate nouns, drop the Dagesh Forte in the final letter when it lacks a vowel
    4. Often change vowels
        * Propretonic reduction - often without the plural ending, a reduced propretonic vowel in the plural will be a long vowel in the singular
        * Recognize the plural pattern of a Segholate noun
    5. Memorize the most common irregular pluralizations (Anki will have both singular and plural forms of these words)

Of course, the more vocabulary words you know, the less you will need to mechanically go through these steps!

> Hebrew does not allow two consecutive reduced vowels in a word to remain (or "stand")
    
* If you see two Sheva in a row in the text, the second one must be Silent
    * We remember the reduced vowels are _Vocal_ Sheva, Hateph Patach, Hateph Seghol, and Hateph Qamets Hatuf
    * _Silent_ Sheva is not a reduced vowel; it's not a vowel at all
* Sometimes, according to grammar rules, we end up with a scenario where we would have two reduced vowels such as two Vocal Sheva, back to back - this is another conflict that must be resolved
    * Grammar rules sometimes REQUIRE two reduced vowels next to each other
    * Grammar rules also PROHIBIT two reduced vowels next to each other
    * <u>The "prohibit" rule wins!</u>
* The "Rule of Sheva" defines what happens to resolve: **the first reduced vowel lengthens to become a short vowel**
* We must learn to recognize when a word has vowels modified because of the Rule of Sheva

::: {.box .light}
If a word BEGINS with a short vowel followed by a reduced vowel, it may originally have been two reduced vowels

1. Two vocal Sheva (No Gutturals or Yod): - the two Vocal Sheva become **Hireq + Silent Sheva** 
    * In other words, say you're reading the Hebrew Bible and you see a word that has $I + :$.  
    * Your Hebrew grammar antenna should go up and you should wonder whether this was originally two vocal sheva
2. Two Reduced vowels (The _second) consonant is a Yod) - "converts" to the vowel letter $\hat I$ (Hireq+yod)
    * This is surprisingly frequent in Hebrew

RULE OF SHEVA

* Understanding that a syllable may have “originally” had a reduced vowel is an important clue in translating and parsing
* Taking time to learn when an original form has been altered by the Rule of Sheva will be extremely important as we move into Unit 3
* Remember a Silent Sheva is not a reduced vowel; it is not a vowel at all - it is not affected by the Rule of Sheva

:::


> In subsequent lessons, we will learn that many prefixes have a Sheva.  When such a prefix is followed by a consonant with a reduced vowel, we can expect to see the effects of the Rule of Sheva

This lesson may have felt like you were "drinking from a firehose" as the saying goes.  Well, often that's how it is with learning a language. Remember, this is a self-paced course; most likely you are not on any external timeline.  Be patient and give these concepts time to soak in.  Remember the concept of feeling like you are in "the fog" is completely natural.

Over time, Anki will help these concepts to "stick" - if you are struggling with Anki then, as we've said before, come back here to re-review the material.  If you feel you need a detailed, academic approach, [Dr. Beckman's course lectures](http://youtu.be/9LxaKsDifCo) are available on YouTube, but we would recommend to try Anki first.  You may be absorbing more than you think you are.

Once you get the hang of them, we're confident you will find that Hebrew noun concepts and the Rule of Sheva are not that difficult to grasp.

* `Lesson 04 A. Vocab`
* `Lesson 04 B. Grammar` 
* `Lesson 04 C. Workbook` 
    * With Lesson 4, we are gradually increasing the depth of work in `Anki`
    * The `Workbook` will have short activities such as translation, examples of concepts taught in the lesson and word "parsing"
    * When we parse a Hebrew word, we identify three things:
        * the Person (if applicable), Number, and Gender of the word
        * the Lexical form
        * the definition of the original word
    * For example, if the instruction is to parse <span class="he">שִׁירִים</span>, we would respond with: "MP שִׁיר  Songs"
    * You may not know every word -
        * **That is the point of this exercise!**  
        * As you read your Hebrew Bible, you will invariably come across words you don't know.  
        * It is important to be able to break down a word into its Lexical form so you can look it up
        * In the [appendix](#lexicon), we have links to some lexicons (dictionaries) you may use with this course.  You can download an abridged version [here](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"} 
    * Future lessons will incorporate additional aspects into our parsing activities, such as verb conjugation
* `Lesson 04 D. Study Verses`
    * We will continue with study verses that provide examples of the Lesson's vocabulary
    * Hints will be provided for less familiar verbs

YOUR QUEST

1. Find one regular singular segholate noun in V1. (yellow)   This word is repeated several times in Ruth 1.
    * In this verse, there is also a segholate noun with a propositional prefix that we haven't studied yet; because of the prefix, this word also takes on vowel changes, which we'll cover in a few lessons
2. Find all words that are regular masculine plural in the chapter (blue). 
    * Some words are prefixed with the definite article הַ, which we will cover in the next lesson.  
3. Find all regular Feminine plural nouns in the chapter (pink).  
    * One of the words in verses 2-6 has a MP ending but is actually an irregular FP.
    * There are two words in verses 12 and 13 that have the FP ending but are verbs not nouns.  At this stage of your Quest you are not expected to know the difference.  Identify them and then we'll discuss on the answer key.
    * Be sure to research any words you don't know. HLI has a [lexicon available here.](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}
3. <span class="he">כַלֹּתֶיהָ
</span> is a word meaning her daughters-in-law (in verse 22, this word is in the singular). Find all four examples of these feminine nouns, including one with the "and" prefix (grey)
4. Find the vocabulary word <span class="he">עִיר</span>. In Ruth 1, it appears as <span class="he">הָעִיר</span>. In the next lesson, we will learn about the prefix ה
