> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must identify the definite article and the conjunction Vav whenever we see them in a word.

As we say often, our focus with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is not to write or speak Biblical Hebrew but to _read and comprehend_ Biblical Hebrew.  In this lesson, the sections that deal with meaning are more important than those that deal with the specific spelling<small>^[<small>In contrast, _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_ places significant emphasizes on learning the spelling rules. This is not wrong; it is just not our approach.</small>]</small>.

It is unlikely you will ever need to write the article or the conjunction with the correct vowel. We discuss these spelling details because you must know how to recognize them in the Bible when you encounter them.

* The Vav conjunction serves _many_ different purposes in Hebrew
    * Some of these can be translated into English
    * Other times there is no direct English translation; these uses can be more like "stage directions" in a play that the directors and actors see in the script but are not read aloud
* When translating the Vav, we must make sure our translation fits the context
    * Most often, it merely means "and", but other options can include then, and then, but, also, even, together with, that is  
    * Occasionally, the best option is to leave it untranslated
* When you were learning English, we had it drilled into us that we should never begin sentences with "and" or have multiple "and" clauses in a sentence
    * We were told these are "run-on sentences", and they were to be avoided
* Hebrew LOVES to start sentences with "and", and is just fine with run-on sentences!
* As you advance in Hebrew, you will enjoy seeing how the Bible authors employ the Vav at the beginning of a sentence or clause to evoke different meanings
    * For example, when added to a verb, it usually serves to continue or advance the narrative
    * When added to a non-verb, it is often those stage directions we mentioned: a contrast, a scene shift, or a parenthetical comment
* It's safe to say, there is a LOT packed in to this little letter <span class="he">ו</span>!


::: {.box .info}
TRANSLATION TIPS

* As you are starting out in Hebrew, go ahead and start your translation of the Vav Conjunction with "And", but remember to be flexible
* Another word, such as "but" or "then" might make more sense depending on the context of the passage
* Many times for smooth English, we will need to leave the Vav untranslated

* The Vav conjunction is usually <span class="he">וְ</span> prefixed to a word
* You will see <span class="he">וּ</span> before  <span class="he">במפ</span> - remember "BuMP"- this is the ONLY time a vowel will ever begin a syllable
    * The <span class="he">ב</span> and <span class="he">פ</span> will lose their Dagesh Lene 
    * It's <span class="he">בֵּן</span>, (between), but it's <span class="he">וּבֵן</span> (and between)
    * The conjunction will also be <span class="he">וּ</span> before a consonant that has a Sheva
* You may see <span class="he">וָ</span> before some accented syllables (remember the Vowel-Syllable preferences)
* Since Vav takes a Vocal Sheva, the Rule of Sheva applies when <span class="he">וְ</span> is prefixed to a word beginning with a reduced vowel (Vocal Sheva or Hateph vowel)

::: {.box .info}
How to tell the difference between the conjunction and words that start with <span class="he">ו</span>?

* **A Vav or Shureq as the first letter of a word is ALMOST ALWAYS the conjunction Vav.**
* Only 10 words start with Vav, and only two occur more than once
    * <span class="he">וָו</span> means "hook," and  <span class="he">וָוִים</span> means "hooks - occurs 13 times in Exodus 26-38, talking about the hooks for the Tabernacle
    * <span class="he">וַשְׁתִּי</span> - Queen Vashti - it appears only in the book of Esther

* We've been referencing the Dagesh Forte in almost every Lesson of this course; you're probably getting the idea that the Daghesh Forte must be kind of a big deal. 
    * It is.  Now we're about to see another reason why as we move in to our discussion of the Hebrew Article
* We like to think of the Dagesh Forte as your friend
    * When you see it, it is Hebrew's way of saying "pay attention; something is different"
* Sometimes the Dagesh Forte gets rejected from time to time
* We've discussed two of those already, and in this lesson, we'll add a third; We'll also now introduce a concept called "compensatory lengthening", which we'll define in the next section
* The two we've already discussed are:
    * Gutturals/Resh ALWAYS reject the Daghesh Forte (Lesson 2)
    * A word-final consonant without a vowel ALWAYS rejects the Daghesh Forte (Lesson 4)
* The new guideline  for this lesson is: A SQiN eM LeVY consonant with a Sheva SOMETIMES rejects the Dagesh Forte
    * When this happens, there is NEVER compensatory lengthening
    * Remember we had you memorize the ten SQiN eM LeVY consonants in Lesson 1.  Do you remember them?
* See table below for a summary of these three rules:

| Loss of Daghesh Forte Scenario | Rejects Dagesh | Compensatory Lengthening
| :-: | :-: | :-: 
| Gutturals/Resh | Always | Sometimes
| Word-final consonant without a Vowel (Lesson 4) | Always | Sometimes
| **SQiN eM LeVY WITH SHEVA** | SOMETIMES | NEVER

SQiN eM LeVY Rule

* Please don't worry if you don't understand this at first
* When you start to see the SQiN eM LeVY rule in action, it will get easier
* See [this handout](./images/05_sqin_em_levy.pdf){target="_blank"} for additional discussion on SQiN eM LeVY consonants

* In Compensatory Lengthening, a short vowel _lengthens_ to become a long vowel to _compensate_ for the loss of a "doubling" Dagesh Forte (or sometimes a vowel) in the following consonant
    * Patach will lengthen to Qamets
    * Hireq will lengthen to Tsere
    * Qibbuts will lengthen to Holem
* Compensatory Lengthening can occur in ANY letter that precedes a Dagesh Forte-rejecting consonant...but it does not _always_ occur
* Compensatory Lengthening can also occur in a word with a Quiescent Aleph that rejects a Sheva.

::: {.infobox .info}
* When SQiN eM LeVY consonants reject the Dagesh, there is NEVER compensatory lengthening.
* Sometimes there is no change to the preceding vowel - this is called "virtual doubling."  As Dr. Van Pelt, the co-author of Basics of Biblical Hebrew likes to say 
""Virtual Doubling" should be called "virtually no doubling", because no spelling changes occur."

ARTICLE

* Hebrew just has one article for definiteness
* It is often simply called the "Article"
* The Hebrew "Article" is equivalent to the English "Definite Article"  
:::

* In English, we have two "indefinite articles" = "a" or "an", and one "definite article" = "the"
* Strictly speaking, Hebrew has no "indefinite article"
* The Hebrew (definite) article has many translations: "the", "this", "o" (as in "O king"), "his", "her", "my".
* <span class="he">הַיּוֹם</span> is literally "the day"; however, a better translation is "today", or sometimes "this day"
* The Hebrew article can also make an adjective superlative: <span class="he">הַתּוֹב</span> is literally "the good", but can mean "the best".

    * Virtual Doubling

    * Compensatory Lengthening

* Hebrew (and Greek) lacks an indefinite article 
* A word without the Article is indefinite

* The Article is not the only way Hebrew indicates definiteness
* An individual's name and most proper nouns are definite by definition.
    * <span class="he">דָּוִד</span> is definite
        * We will never see: <span class="he">*הַדָּוִד</span>
        * In English we would never say "The Izzy teaches Hebrew".  It's just "Izzy teaches Hebrew".
        * On the other hand, names of people groups and some geographic features often take the article. <span class="he">הַיַּרְדֵּן</span>= the Jordan River.
* A word with a pronominal suffix is definite since the suffix indicates possession, and possession is definite<small>^[Pronominal suffixes are the subject of Lesson 9</small>]</small>.  
    * In English, we don't say "his the book"; we say, "his book".  "Book" is understood to be definite.
* A Hebrew word in its construct state is definite when the last word in the construct chain is definite  
    * A construct chain in English might be "the book of the sister of the king"; in other words in English we generally do add the definite article
    * Hebrew would literally be, "book of sister of the king", but all words in the chain are understood to be definite
    * We will discuss construct chains in Lesson 10

You made it through another lesson!  Way to go!  Even though we only studied two concepts - the word for "and" and the word for "the" - these concepts in Hebrew are quite different from English.

You may be noticing how each new lesson builds upon the previous ones. If something isn't entirely making sense, or if you find yourself asking, "why in the world do I need to know this?" just be patient, and it should start to come together in a lesson or two.  Now might also be an excellent time to look back and see how far you have come in just five lessons.

As far as activities, we have the warm-up videos, Anki, the Ruth Pursuit, and the Quest Quiz. When you finish all of that, we have our second `Twelve Tribes Badge` you can claim.

Take your time and let these oncepts in this chapter sink in.  You're about half-way through the "non-verbs" portion of the course.  Lessons 6-10 will be continuing to build out sentences with prepositions, adjectives, and pronouns.  Then we'll take a little bit of a break with numbers in Lesson 11 before moving on to Unit 3 and Hebrew verbs.

Keep with it; you're doing great!

YOUR QUEST

1. Find five examples of the conjunction vav: וְ (note the Vocal Sheva) (Yellow)
2. find five examples of the standard definite article ּ  הַ (Green)
3. Find the first three examples of "Compensatory Lengthening" of the definite article.  There is one example of "Virtual Doubling" of the definite article in verses 10-15.  Can you find it? (Light Blue)
4. הִנֵה is a widespread Biblical expression that means, "look!" or "behold." Find the one example of הִנֵה in Ruth 1. (Pink)
5. Find all instances of <span class="he">אִישׁ</span> (man), and <span class="he">אִשָּׁה</span>, wife/woman. (grey) 
    * In verses 1 and 2, note that <span class="he">אִשְׁתּוֹ</span> has a pronominal suffix, so the word means "his wife."  Words that normally end with a ה tend to lose the ה when suffixes are added. We'll study more about pronominal suffixes in Lessons 9 and 19.
    * In verses 12 and 13, note that <span class="he">לְאִישׁ
</span> has a prepositional prefix mean "to" or "for."  We will learn about prepositions in the next lesson.
6. Find the vocabulary word <span class="he">כֹּה</span>. It appears once with the Vav conjunction and once without. (red)
