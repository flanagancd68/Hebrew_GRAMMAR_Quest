# Hebrew Prepositions 

> In order to comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to identify prepositions, which give us a sense of space and location as we read the Text.

## Nun with Silent Sheva Becomes Daghesh Forte

You may be wondering what this has to do with prepositions, but stick with us.  It will make sense by the end of the lesson!

Nun is considered a "weak letter" and it has a tendency to drop out of a word under certain scenarios. When the nun appears with a SILENT sheva נְ is one of those times.  You remember how we said that the Daghesh Forte is your friend, because it tells you that something has changed?  When then nun drops, whenever possible it will be replaced with a Daghesh Forte.  The technical term for this is called "assimilation".   

מִנְזָהָב* > מִזָּהָב


This is why we spend time talking about when the Daghesh Forte might get rejected.  Do you remember the three times we have studied where the Daghesh Forte may be rejected?  

* Gutturals and Resh
* At the end of a word
* With a SQiN eM LeVY with a Sheva: מִנְקְצֵה* > מִקְּצֵה* > מִקְצֵה

## Independent prepositions 

There are three different types of Hebrew prepositions: independent, Maqqef, and inseparable. 

An independent preposition is a separate word with a space before it and after it.

The preposition comes first, followed by its object (just like English).

* Most Hebrew prepositions are written this way. – E.g.,  תַּחַת אֹתוֹ
* English prepositions are written this way. – E.g., Under it

## Maqqef prepositions 

Maqqef is the Hebrew word for dash.  They are nearly identical in meaning and appearance except the Hebrew Maqqef is raised ־ whereas the English is middle -

A Maqqef connects a preposition to its object. Again, the preposition comes first.

עָל־מֶלֶךְ

English prepositions are NOT written this way.  You would never see on-a-king

You may see the same preposition written both with and without the Maqqef.  The meaning does not change.  עַל מֶלֶךְ means the same as עַל־מֶלֶךְ


## Inseperable prepositions

Like וְ for the word "and", an inseperable preposition is a one-letter prefix that is affixed to its object.

Three Hebrew prepositions are **ALWAYS** written this way, usually with a Vocal Sheva:

```{r, out.width = "200pt", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/05.inseparable.png")
```

If there is a Sheva after the preposition, the Rules of Sheva come into play:
