_He has made everything appropriate (beautiful) in its time.  (Ecclesiastes 3:11)_

Offer a word of gratitude that HaShem has made you beautiful!

<span class="he">יָפֶה</span> is an example of predicate adjective use, which we will study in this lesson.

View this 5-minute overview video from _Hebrew Quest_ Lesson 13.  If you looked at the Lesson Itinerary, you may not have been previously familiar with the terms "attributive" and "predicative" in terms of adjectives. In the video, when Izzy says, "the good trees", this is called the ATTRIBUTIVE use. When he says, "the trees are good", this is the PREDICATIVE use.

## Inflecting Adjectives

Adjective inflection is relatively straight-forward.

We will use the paradigm word <span class="he">טוֹב</span> to illustrate

```{r, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/07_adjective_gif.gif")
```

::: {.box .light}
WHY WOULD WE NEED TO INFLECT?

* Technically we don't; we will never be asked in reading the Hebrew Bible to take a MS adjective and inflect it into the FP
* We DO need to be able to identify the gender and number of an adjective based on its ending
* We MAY also need to identify the lexical form of an unfamiliar adjective when it has an ending and the vowels have changed
* For these reasons, learning adjectival inflection is beneficial
:::

1. An adjective is either masculine or feminine
2. An adjective is either singular or plural (dual nouns take plural adjectives)
3. An adjective will match the gender and number of the noun that it modifies or for which it substitutes
    * This is a big difference from nouns, which can change number but never gender
    * Note that for irregular nouns, the adjective will not necessarily match the exact ending
    * <span class="he">נָשִׁים טוֹבוֹת</span> - even though "<span class="he">נָשִׁים</span>" has the irregular -im ending, the adjective <span class="he">טוֹבוֹת</span> remains the regular feminine plural
4. An adjective will use expected gender and number endings as shown in the graphic above
5. The Lexical Form of an adjective is the MS
    * The MS form is usually endingless
    * The MS can be Seghol+Hei as in <span class="he">יָפֶה</span>, which is MS for pleasing, beautiful.

::: {.box .caution}
Note that unlike <span class="he">טוֹב</span>, most adjectives undergo vowel changes when the inflectional endings are added. 

The good news is you already know what to do. Adjectives follow the same rules as nouns.

## Substantival Use

::: {.infobox .sound}
<figure> <audio id="myAudio" controls controlsList="nodownload"

var x = document.getElementById("myAudio");
function x05() { 
    x.playbackRate = 0.5;
    x.play();}
function x075() { 
    x.playbackRate = 0.75;
    x.play();} 
function x1() { 
    x.playbackRate = 1;
     x.play();}
function x15() { 
    x.playbackRate = 1.5;
     x.play();} 
function x2() { 
    x.playbackRate = 2;
     x.play();} 
function x25() { 
    x.playbackRate = 2.5;
     x.play(); } 
</script></figure>
:::
* In the Substantival use, the adjective acts as a noun
    * We could say the "Substantive Substitutes" for a noun
    * Perhaps an obvious example of this from pop culture is the film "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"  
        * The three words, "good", "bad", and "ugly" are adjectives being used as nouns
        * They are substantival adjectives
* In the substantival use, the noun is implied but not stated
    * It could be the "good one", the "bad man", or the "ugly idol"
* Remember that Hebrew gender does not always refer to an animate object
    * <span class="he">הַטּוֹבָה</span> - "the good" 
    * The word above is "the good (feminine singular something)"
    * Depending on the context, it could be "the good woman", or a feminine object like "the good Torah"

::: {.box .light}
SUBSTANTIVAL USE IS RELATIVELY EASY TO IDENTIFY 

* When you see an adjective but no related noun that matches in gender and number, the adjective is in the Substantival Use
* Think "the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"

## Attributive Use

     x.play();} 
function x25() { 
    x.playbackRate = 2.5;
     x.play(); } 
</script></figure>
:::
* In the Attributive use, the adjective modifies and describes a noun
    * "Good" in "The good book" is Attributive 
* Hebrew makes it much easier to identify the Attributive use - see the mnemonic below
    * The adjective MUST come AFTER the noun it modifies
    * It MUST AGREE in definiteness 
        * This means both the noun and the adjective either HAVE the definite article or they both WILL NOT have the article
* <span class="he">הָאִשָּׁה הָטּוֹבָה</span> - the good woman
* <span class="he">אִשָּׁה טוֹבָה</span> - a good woman (or "the woman is good"-predicate use; see next section)

function x25() { 
    x.playbackRate = 2.5;

</script></figure>
:::
* The Predicative use (often called the predicate use) asserts something about the noun
* In English translation, we must insert the applicable form of the verb "to be"
* The noun is the subject, and the adjective is the predicate of the sentence: "The book is good."
* In some ways, the rules for Hebrew Predicative use are the opposite of Attributive rules
    * The Predicative adjective will NEVER have the article
    * The Predicative adjective can come before or after the noun
    * The only ambiguity is when both the adjective and noun are indefinite and the adjective comes after the noun
* Examples:
    * <span class="he">טוֹבָה הָאִשָּׁה</span> - "the woman is good"
    * <span class="he">הָאִשָּׁה טוֹבָה</span> - "the woman is good"
    * <span class="he">טוֹבָה אִשָּׁה </span>- "a woman is good"
    * <span class="he">אִשָּׁה טוֹבָה</span> - this can either be Attributive "a good woman" or "a woman is good"

As a brief review, determine whether the adjective is acting as Attributive, Predicative, or Substantival.  The answers and explanations are in the footnotes.

* <span class="he">הָאִשָּׁה הָטּוֹבָה</span> -^[**ATTRIBUTIVE - "Attributive Always After, Article Agrees"**  While a Predicative adjective can occur after the noun, this example can't be Predicative because the adjective has the article - "Predicate dePrived of Article..."]
* <span class="he">טוֹבָה הָאִשָּׁה</span> -^[**PREDICATIVE - "Predicative dePrived of article, Perhaps Prior"**  This example can't be attributive because the adjective comes before the noun and the article does not agree - "Attributive Always After, Article Agrees"]
* <span class="he">הָאִשָּׁה טוֹבָה</span> -^[**PREDICATIVE - "Predicative dePrived of article..."** This example can't be Attributive because the article does not agree  "Attributive Always After, Article Agrees"]
* <span class="he">טוֹבָה אִשָּׁה</span> -^[**PREDICATIVE - "Predicative dePrived of Article, Perhaps Prior"**While the adjective and noun agree in definiteness (both are indefinite), this example can't be Attributive because the adjective comes before the noun: "Attributive Always After..."]
* <span class="he">אִשָּׁה טוֹבָה</span> -^[**ATTRIBUTIVE or PREDICATIVE** The only time there can be any ambiguity between Attributive and Predicative is when the adjective comes after the noun and both are indefinite.  In these situations, we need to let the context determine the use]
* <span class="he">הַטּוֹבָה</span> -^[**SUBSTANTIVAL** This example can't be Attributive or Predicative because there is no noun that the adjective is modifying]

* The Mappiq is a mark that you will see when reading the text
* The Mappiq looks exactly like a Daghesh (Lene or Forte), but it ONLY is found in the letter <span class="he">ה</span> and ONLY when it is the last letter of a word
    * Gutturals never take either Daghesh
    * Dagesh are never in the final letter of a word
* A word-final <span class="he">ה</span> is always part of a vowel unless it has a Mappiq (<span class="he">הּ</span>).
* The Mappiq is a sign that the breathy sound of the consonantal hei should be accentuated slightly
* It does not affect the word's meaning or syllabification

YOUR QUEST

1. Locate a few of the Mappiq marks (yellow)
2. Vocabulary words (green)
    1. Find the Hebrew word for "name," that you learned in the Lesson 3 Vocab; frequently, the word has the Vav conjunction
    2. Find the word for "very"
    3. Find the word for "daughters" - it occurs with a pronominal suffix, and means "my daughters"
    4. Find the phrase joined with a Maqqef that means "to the land (of)"
3. Other words (pink)
    1. Towards the end of the chapter, Naomi says, "don't call me Naomi (pleasant) call me 'Mara' (bitter)
        * Find the word for "bitter"
        * It occurs twice in two different forms
    2. Find the word for "Orpah"
    3. <span class="he">רֵיקָם</span> is a word that means "empty." It only occurs 16x in the entire Bible, and almost always with the sense of sending someone away empty-handed.<small>^[<small>A chuckle-worthy example is 1st Samuel 6:3 when the Philistines realize that the Ark is causing nothing but trouble for them.  They purposed to send the Ark back to Israel, but said "send it not empty!" They sent it back with trespass offerings representing the plagues they suffered: five golden mice and five golden tumors, which some scholars believe were actually hemorrhoids!</small>]</small>. In Ruth 1, Naomi said she left full but was sent back empty.  Find the lone example of this word near the end of the chapter.
