# Numerals/counting

> In order to comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to figure out numbers, with or without a dictionary, when we encounter them in the Bible


You have worked very hard on the first 10 lessons!  Way to go!  While a discussion on numbers and counting is often interweaved in a discussion with the Aleph-Bet, the authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u>, wisely in our opinion, strategically placed a necessary but lighter discussion on numerals right here in Lesson 11.  We are emerging from what may be a lot of foggy concepts with all of the noun, pronoun, and adjective concepts in lessons 4-10 (particularly Lessons 8-10).  The bulk of the work in this Lesson will be in `Anki` learning numbers from _Hebrew Quest_.

For the next 25 lessons we will be exclusively focused on the Hebrew verbal system and -- the entire point of this course -- reading and understanding Scripture.

Enjoy this brief lesson on numbers!

## First Thought {-}

Give Him praise that you are among those counted as His talmidim (disciples)!

> (Joshua 4:2 NASB) Take for yourselves twelve men from the people  
> קְחוּ לָכֶם מִן־הָעָם שְׁנֵים עָשָׂר אֲנָשִׁים

## The Biblical text always spells out numbers

This is point number 1.  There is not a lot of elaboration needed except to note that this is the case.  You will not see "1", "200", or "969", either in modern symbols or in Rabbinic symbols (using the Aleph-bet) in the Hebrew text.

## Notes and footnotes use symbols for numbers

You may come across a system of counting that uses numerical values for each of the Hebrew letters.  This is interesting and the Rabbis have a lot of fun with comparing words that have identical numerical values.

* א ב ג ד ה ו ז ח ת represent 1-9
* י כ ל מ נ ס ע פ צ represent 10-90 by tens
    * So to say 33, would be 30 and 3 = לג or often ל״ג, with the ״ indicating that this is not a real word
* ק ר ש ת are 100, 200, 300, and 400, then we go to the sofit forms ך ם ן ף ץ for 500-900
* In some reckonings, a series of dots or diamonds above the letters, or ’ is used for numbers above 999.  For example 1000 is ’א


## Be Familiar with Hebrew Ordinal Numbers - First through Tenth

Ordinal numbers denote order.  first, second, third

In Hebrew, these are attributive adjectives, so they follow the noun and match in gender, number and definiteness (Attributive Always After, Always Agree).

* יוֹם רִאשׁוֹן or הַיּוֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן = first day or the first day

To denote the 11th position or higher, we would use cardinal numbers

* בִּשְׁנַת הָאַרְבָּעִים  = in the year of the forty = in the 40th year

## Hebrew Cardinal Numbers

* One is an attributive adjective - it follows its noun and agrees in gender, number and definiteness
    * As we mentioned previously, it is sometimes used as an indefinite article
    * אִישׁ אֵחָד = one man = a man
* Two through Ten are nouns
    * They have both masculine and feminine forms
    * They have absolute and construct forms
* Higher numbers are nouns with no specific gender


## Digits 1 and 2 match the gender of the noun

For example:

* בֵּן אֶחָד = one son
* בַּת אַחַת = one daughter

## Digits 3-10 take the opposite gender of the noun

Additionally they are "singular" even though the noun is plural.  This makes sense when you think that the plural form of 3 is actually the word for 30 (see next section).

For example:

* שְׁלֹשָׁה בָּנִים = three sons
* שְׁלֹשׁ בָּנוֹת = three daughters

The technical term for this is "chiastic concord" (you don't need to know this)

## Learn the Cardinal Numbers Above 10

* 11-19
    * 11-12 match gender, 13-19 swap
        * 11 אַחַד אָשָֹר
        * 13 שְׁלֹשָׁה אָשָֹר
* Decades are spelled as masculine plural of the unit
    * 3 = שָׁלֹשׁ  
    * 30 = שְׁלֹשִׁים
        
## Conclusion

This chapter omits many details about numbers and counting.  Our aim was to provide an introduction so that when you encounter numbers in the Bible, you will have some basic familiarity.

If you are interested in going a little deeper, we encourage you to view the complete [Hebrew Quest segment on numerals](https://holylanguage.com/grammar-1.php){target="_blank"}. 

For Hebrew GRAMMAR quest it is sufficient for you to learn the Ordinals (first through 10th - for 1-7 we will learn Izzy's days of the week song) and the Cardinals 1-10, then 20-100 by 10s, and 1000.
