> CONGRATULATIONS ON FINISHING THE FIRST TWO UNITS OF HEBREW GRAMMAR QUEST!

* Unit III represents a pivot point in this course
* From now through the end of the course, we will focus on verbs
* In Unit III we will be spending our time learning what is called the Qal verb stem in depth
* Then in Unit IV we will learn the six so-called "derived" stems


We wanted to let you know of some changes:


1. Vowel Shorthand
2. $Pre$ = a diagnostic word-initial combination
3. Changes to Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest for Units III and IV
    1. No more quizzes!
    2. Study Verses
        * Cantillation marks added to study verses
        * Verses in `Anki` will be taken as a whole, not split into smaller components
    3. Honors Track: _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage Translation
    

The next few pages will describe these changes in greater detail.

Now is the time to download the current [Unit III Anki deck](#decks){target="_blank"} if you haven't already done so!

We will begin to use the vowel transliteration introduced in Lesson 2


* Short Vowels (no marking): $A$ for Patach, $E$ for Seghol, $I$, Hireq, $O$ for Qamets Hatuf, and $U$, Qibbuts
* Long Vowels that are not letters (bar): $\bar A$ for Qamets, $\bar E$ for Tsere, and $\bar O$ for Holem
* Unchangeable Long Vowels (hat): $\hat E$ = Tsere+Yod, $\hat I$ = Hireq+Yod; $\hat O$ = Holem+Vav, and $\hat U$ = Shureq
* Additionally, we have Vocal Sheva = $ə$, and $:$ for Silent Sheva^[Vocal Sheva (as well as the Hateph vowels) has a "hurried" pronunciation, like the _a_ in _amuse_. ə is the [international character for this sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel){target="_blank"}. Silent Sheva has no pronunciation or transliteration value.]

* A Hebrew strong verb conjugation, regardless of the stem, can usually be identified based on its initial combination of consonants, vowels, and from time-to-time, the presence of a Dagesh Forte
* For example, in Lesson 15, we will learn the "Imperfect Preformatives" (we'll describe what a preformative is a little later)
    * The 3ms and 3mp strong forms will always have:
        * Preformative consonant = Yod
        * $V_P = I$ (Hireq), and
        * $V_1 = \ :$ (Silent Sheva)
    * We can further shorten this by saying $Pre =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span>,
        * <span class="he">י</span> represents any Imperfect Preformative
        * <span class="he">ק</span> represents $R_1$ of any strong verb
    * $Pre$ is the word-initial combination of preformatives, vowels, and possibly a Dagesh that can help us identify and translate a specific verb form

* The quizzes in Units I and II provided a checkpoint before proceeding to the next lesson
    * We wanted to make sure you had the essential components of the lesson
* At this stage of the course, we can dispense with the quizzes and leave it up to your judgment as to whether you are ready to proceed with the next lesson
* The overload workload is steadily increasing, and of course, the Anki reviews are growing (so be sure to keep up with daily reviews!)
* If you would like additional practice work, including quizzes, check out the `Lesson Extras`

* In Unit II, we split longer verses into two sections; starting with Unit III, we're going to take it up a notch and have you review the entire study verse in one answer
* For Unit III, we are also adding Cantillation Marks added to Study Verses
    * These are the marks in addition to vowels and consonants we sometimes see in Hebrew
    * Here is the example we looked at from Genesis:

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/02.Gen0109.png")
```

* Why do this?
    * When you read from a Tanach, you are much more likely to encounter the complete set of Hebrew accent marks
    * Becoming more comfortable with the Hebrew Bible includes having a basic familiarity with these additional marks
* Things to keep in mind:
    * There are over 20 different cantillation marks
    * We won't go into what each one means, but there are plenty of resources on the Internet if you are interested in digging deeper
    * Most often, there is only one cantillation mark per word - <u>where you see the mark is where the accent goes</u>
    * Occasionally, you will see a mark near the front or middle of the word, as well as a mark near the end of a word         
        * The first mark is a secondary accent
        * Remember, a primary Hebrew accent can ONLY be on the LAST or SECOND-TO-LAST syllable
* The vertical line | that can appear between two words can be ignored
* When in doubt, listen to Izzy's audio carefully as he reads each verse to determine where the accent goes
* Trying to read with these marks can be visually distracting and overwhelming at first
    * With practice, you will get used to them
    * Cantillation marks are part of the rich tradition of Biblical Hebrew passed down to us from many centuries ago


::: {.box .caution}
Many cantillation marks look like a vowel in the wrong place

* If you see a mark that is not a vowel you recognize (such as an upside-down wishbone) or in the wrong place (such as a dot directly above a consonant instead of the upper-left, inside or below) it is a cantillation mark.
* You already know your vowels, so don't let these marks trick you!
:::



### Pausal Forms {-}

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/11.50_marks_pausal_forms.jpg")
```

* The above marks are called "major accents"
    * The Silluq looks like a Metheg but isn't; it is found at the end of a verse
    * The athnach divides a verse in half
    * the zaqueph qatan divides a half-verse
    * In some respects, they are similar to the English period, semi-colon, or comma
        * In fact, when translating, we will usually want to put a period or comma whenever we see one of these accents
* In Lesson 3, we briefly mentioned "pausal forms"
* The above accents may cause Pausal forms, and Pausal Forms may change the spelling
    * A Patach, Seghol, or sheva may change to Qamets
        * Example קָטַל becomes קָטָל
    * A sheva may change to a Seghol in the 2ms pronominal suffix (Lesson 19)
        * סוּסְךָ to סוּסֶ֫ךָ
    * Words that are normally accented on the ultima may undergo an accent shift to the penultima with resulting vowel change, for example אֲנִי can become אָ֫נִי

::: {.box .caution}
If you see an unexpected vowel, especially a Qamets, look for one of these accents.  You may have encountered a pausal form.

* `Honors Track: Hebrew Quest Study Passages` are OPTIONAL activities designed for those who seek more opportunities for additional Hebrew Bible reading and translating activity
* They also offer a method to simultaneously complete _Hebrew Quest_ and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest
* Why is this "optional?" 
    * Completion of this activity may require a __significant__ time investment to complete
    * For this reason, completing the `Hebrew Quest Study Passages` are not required to earn any Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest `Badges`, `Certificates`, or the `Graduation Diploma`
    * We call it our `Honors track`, because when you DO complete all of the the Study Passage activities, you will "graduate with honors" and receive special recognition!
        * But your greatest reward will be the knowledge and insights you gain from the Bible!
* Whether you have already completed _Hebrew Quest_ or not, this activity is sure to significantly expand your Hebrew reading skills
* We will start off slowly with the verses from the Proverbs study
* Then we will go in _Hebrew Quest_ order, beginning with Genesis 1 (_Hebrew Quest_ Lesson 17) through 1 Kings 18 (_Hebrew Quest_ Lesson 40)
* Here is what we want you to do in these Study Passages activities:
    1. Download the applicable study passage document
    2. Read and listen the passage straight through to gain an overview
    3. Read again, but this time, compose a translation
        1. First, see how much you can do without a reference
        2. Then, look up any words you don't know in a lexicon
        3. Parts of this are meant for students who have finished the course but you may wish to review Dr. Beckman's lecture on [How to prepare a passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v8KvmEtZy0&t=2918s){target="_blank"}
    4. Watch the _Hebrew Quest_ video where Izzy reads and breaks down the passage, often with spiritual insights^[Note: Izzy intentionally speaks very slowly, so as you advance in Hebrew, you may wish to increase the speed of the YouTube video].
        * As you are watching, compare your translation with Izzy's explanation
        * How did you do?  Can you see how much you are learning?
        * For Tanach passages, [this website](https://scholarsgateway.com/search/WLC-KJV%201611-ESV/Genesis/1:1-5) has information on parts of speech and PGN information when you hover over a word^[As Hebrew is not the official original language of the Apostolic Writings ([or is it?](), there is no equivalent for the Gospel or Revelation passages.)]
    5. Ask what the Spirit of Holiness, the Ruach HaKodesh, is teaching you
    6. As desired, complete _Hebrew Quest Memrise_(https://app.memrise.com/course/5406435/hebrew-quest-lessons-1-to-40/){target="_blank"} - this is entirely optional

``` 


* The image above is of the Jordan River baptismal area in Israel near Jericho - it was taken less than a month after extensive flooding of the area
* Lessons 13-16 could be considered the "high-water mark" of the course
    * There will be a lot of details to digest as we talk about the two most common verb forms in the Bible, the Qal Perfect and the Qal Imperfect
    * YOU MUST MASTER the material in these four chapters
    * Doing so will make the rest of the course much smoother, and more importantly, this will help you better understand your Hebrew Bible
* The "high water" will start to recede a little starting with Lesson 17
* The rest of the course from Lessons 17-35 build upon Chapters 13-16
* Take your time - as Izzy says, "slow and steady wins your Hebrew verbal race!", but keep pushing forward
* We can do this! This is all part of learning God's Holy Language!
