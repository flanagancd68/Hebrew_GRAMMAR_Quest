> Hebrew is a verbal, action-oriented language.  Now that we have concluded our discussion on nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and prepositions, we will now focus on verbs.

Around 70% of Hebrew verbs are in what we call the Qal stem, so we will spend Lessons 13-22 (in other words, Unit III) learning that stem inside and out.  Qal verbs represent "simple action", or active voice with a simple unnuanced type of action.^[The derived stems are different combinations of "voice" (active, passive, or reflexive) and "action" (simple or causative)]

Our quest is to translate accurately.  To do this, we must identify the root, stem, conjugation, person, gender, and number of verbs. This lesson will provide a detailed introduction to the verb system as a whole and some general conventions.

You might notice there are a lot of sections in this lesson.  Most of these tend to be short introductions.  "Hebrew verbs, meet student.  Student, this are Hebrew verbs."  Frequently, we will take a concept you already learned in Units I and II, then modify it slightly to apply it to verbs.

*But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness . . . (1 Kings 19:4)*

As we begin a long stretch in Hebrew Verbs, at times, you may feel as exhausted, dry, and isolated as if you were Elijah (the subject of 1 Kings 19:4) driven into the wilderness.  

In these times, we must depend on God to sustain us.  It is times like these where God can pour into us and prepare us for our next adventure.  Moses, Elijah, John the Immerser, and several others all had their time in the Wilderness that God used to mold them as servant-leaders.  Of course, we can point to Yeshua himself and his time in the wilderness at the beginning of his ministry.  Embrace the wilderness!

> <span class="he">קטל</span> is meant to represent the three-letter root of _ANY_ "strong" verb^[we'll discuss strong and weak verbs later in this Lesson].
> The actual translation of <span class="he">קטל</span> is not material for our purposes

* As Izzy mentions in the video we just watched, Hebrew grammars for the past several centuries have used the verb <span class="he">קטל</span> as what is called the "paradigm verb"
* What makes <span class="he">קטל</span> awkward is the word means "to kill"
* Think of <span class="he">קטל</span> as being like a math formula
    * In $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, the letters "a", "b", and "c" have no direct, literal meaning
    * In the Pythagorean formula above, "a", "b", and "c" are meant to represent the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle
    * In the same way, the letters <span class="he">.ק.ט.ל</span> are just variable or placeholder letters that are part of a formula with a larger purpose than the direct, literal meaning
* Also, like Izzy says, we can always think of <span class="he">קטל</span> as "killing" sin, bad habits, or things that can interfere in our relationship with the Holy One

* Back in Lesson 4, we discussed the difference between "inflecting" and "parsing"
* Inflecting is when we take a verb root such as <span class="he">מלך</span> and transform it by adding vowels, prefixes or suffixes to generate a specific form with a unique meaning
    * For example, if you were told to inflect <span class="he">מלך</span> into Qal Perfect first-person, common singular (QP1cs), you would provide "<span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span>"
* As we said back in Lesson 4, no part of reading the Hebrew Bible requires you to inflect, so we keep inflecting activities to a minimum
* Parsing can be thought of as going in the reverse direction
    * Say you encounter a verb such as "<span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span>"
    * In time, you will be able to determine that <span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span> is the QP1cs form of <span class="he">מלך</span>, and means "I ruled" or "I was king"
* To accurately translate the Hebrew you read in Scripture, we **will** be doing a lot of parsing

> The inflected person, gender, and number refer to the _subject_ of the verb^[There is one exception. Pronominal suffixes are used to denote the object of the verb.  We will study these in Lesson 19]

* Person, Gender, and Number for verbs are the same as for nouns
* Gender
    * Male, female, or common
    * "Common" gender is for verb forms that could be either M or F; In Hebrew, as in English, the words for "I" and "we" are Common (i.e., there is not a masculine form of "I" and a separate feminine form of "I")
* Person
    * 1st person is the speaker - "I/we sat"
    * 2nd person is the person being spoken to - "you sat"
    * 3rd person is anyone (or any_thing_) else - "he/she/it/they sat"
* Number is either singular or plural - there are no dual verb forms

When parsing, it is standard to use parsing code "3ms" to mean "third person, masculine, singular."

> Hebrew grammars often use the terms "preformative" and "sufformative" exclusively for verbs, and they are distinct from "prefixes" and "suffixes"

* A verbal _preformative_ (if any) goes before $R_1$ and a _sufformative_ (if any) goes after $R_3$
    * A sufformative can also be referred to as an _afformative_ 
* Any _prefix_ such as the interrogative particle, or (commonly) the conjunction vav, goes _before_ the preformative, or before $R_1$ if there is no preformative
* Any _suffix_, such as a pronominal suffix, goes _after_ any sufformative, or the final root consonant

> Identifying a verbal vowel's position is necessary to determine the Verbal Root and the Stem

* We use $V_P$ (a vowel with preformative immediately before $R_1$), $V_1$ and $V_2$ - the vowels with $R_1$ and $R_2$, and $V_S$, which is what is called the _stem_ vowel
    * The $V_S$ vowel is usually the same as the $V_2$ vowel, but can be the $V_1$ vowel in certain situations
    * The vowel associated with $R_3$ turns out to be less important, so we do not need to identify this
* For the verb <span class="he">יִקְטְל֫וּהָ</span>
    * $V_P = I$ (remember I is shorthand for Hireq)
    * $V_1 = \ :$ (Silent Sheva)
    * $V_2$/$V_S = ə$ (Vocal Sheva)
    * Note: while we have said Silent Sheva is technically not a vowel, it is occupying the $R_1$ vowel position.  For this purpose, it is acceptable to say $V_1 = \ :$.

::: {.box .caution}
* While $V_P$ is the prefix or preformative vowel, $V_S$ is NOT the suffix or sufformative vowel
* $V_S$ is the STEM vowel, which is usually but not always $V_2$

> The verb __stem__ indicates the meaning of the verb itself and guides our translation

* At a basic level, the stem provides the _type of action_ and the _voice_ 
    * The table provides a good starting place, but it is not the "final word" on verb stems^[In particular, it has often been thought that Piel indicates an "intensive" action. Modern scholarship has cast some doubt on this. "Causing a state", perhaps iteratively (doing something over and over, which might be a form of intensity) appears to be more precise description of Piel, and is preferred by scholars such as Dr. Beckman.]
    * Note that Hebrew verbs can have any one of several nuanced meanings depending on the context
    * We will discuss these nuances as we introduce each stem

| |Active | Passive  | Reflexive 
|:- |:- |:- |:-
Simple Action	| QAL-Q | Niphal-N | (Niphal)
Cause a State	| Piel-D | Pual-Dp | Hitpael-tD
Cause an Action	|Hiphil-H | Hophal-Hp


* The _QAL_ stem is the basic or simple verb stem.  All other stems are derived from Qal
* The Parsing Code for the Qal is "Q". we'll explain the "Parsing codes" in a few sections 
* Now review the table from the previous section once again to see how the verb stems relate to translations

> While the stem provides the overall meaning, the _conjugation_ provides additional descriptive information needed for translation

* Strictly speaking, Hebrew does not have past, present, future, tense, as with English
    * Instead, the easiest way of thinking about it is that Hebrew has complete vs. incomplete action
    * Perfect is completed action
    * Imperfect is incomplete action
* Like English, Hebrew also has Imperative (Volitional), Infinitive, and Participle conjugations

* Be patient and soak it in
:::



1. The _Perfect_ conjugation describes completed action, whether in the past, present, or future
    * Most often, we translate this as English past tense - "She went"
    * Verbs that describe a state of being as well an action that is completed in the future will be in the Perfect conjugation
    * Parsing code: P
2. The _Imperfect_ conjugation describes an incomplete action, whether in the past, present, or future
    * Most often, we translate this as English future tense - "She will go"
    * Verbs that describe an incomplete process or incomplete action, even if that action is in the past, will tend to be in the Imperfect conjugation
    * Parsing code: I
3. The _Imperative_ 2nd person Volitional - a command: "Go!"
    * Parsing code: M
4. The _Cohortative_ 1st Person Volitional - wish, purpose: "I should go"^[Some grammars classify "Corhortative" and "Jussive" as "Verb Moods" and the remaining as "Verb Tenses."].
    * Parsing code: C
5. The _Jussive_ 3rd Person Volitional - conjugation is similar to the Imperative - "He should go."
    * Parsing code: J
6. The _Infinitive Construct_ Verbal Noun -  "to go", or a verbal noun as in, "going"
    * Parsing code: ∞
7. The _Infinitive Absolute_ Verbal Noun - special uses, less common and has no direct equivalent in English
    * Parsing code: A
8. The _Participle_ - Verbal adjective - "runner," "one who runs"
    * Parsing code: Pt
    
    
::: {.box .info}

Vav prefix

* Some grammars identify other forms, each with a Vav prefix, as additional conjugations/tenses, such as the "Perfect + Vav" and the "Imperfect Vav Consecutive" (sometimes called "Vav Conversive")
* We will discuss these forms further in Lesson 17

* As we stated above, parsing is the process of breaking down a verb into its component parts
* The following should be included when parsing a verb (as applicable):
    * Stem
    * Conjugation
    * Person (only for finite)
    * Gender (except for Infinitive forms)
    * Number (except for Infinitive forms)
    * Either the _Root_ form or the _Lexical_ form
    * Translation^[As beginners, our translations may understandably be literal. As we progress in learning the language, we will begin to incorporate context, figurative language, and the general flexibility many Hebrew words and phrases have.]
* Parsing example: <span class="he">תֹּאמְרוּ</span>
    * Stem: **Qal**
    * Conjugation: **Imperfect**
    * Person (only for finite): **2nd**
    * Gender (except for Infinitive forms): **Masculine**
    * Number (except for Infinitive forms): **Plural**
    * Either the _Root_ form or the _Lexical_ form: **<span class="he">אמר</span>** or **<span class="he">אָמַר</span>** (to say, speak, utter)
    * Translation: **You (all) will say**
* Fortunately we can use a shorthand called "Parsing codes" to abbreviate the Stem, Conjugation, Person, Gender, and Number

* As we get into each stem, there will be separate chapters devoted to strong and week verbs
* Therefore, it will be useful for you to know what we mean by these terms
* Each conjugation will have a basic paradigm that prescribes vowels, accents, preformatives, and sufformatives for each PGN
* Strong verbs will follow this paradigm, so we will call this the "**strong verb paradigm**"
* To use terms familiar to those who may have studied other foreign languages, we might say that Strong Verbs are "regular," and Weak Verbs are "irregular"

> Weak verbs will have one or more weak letters that result in some deviation from the strong verb paradigm

* For example the "Verbs Introduction" video by Izzy, he mentioned how the <span class="he">נ</span> in <span class="he">נתן</span> can disappear in certain forms
    * This is because <span class="he">נ</span> is a weak letter
    * In Units I and II, we have already learned unique characteristics of many weak letters
        * Gutturals reject Vocal Sheva and Dagesh Forte (there may or may not be compensatory lengthening)
        * <span class="he">ר</span> rejects Dagesh Forte
        * <span class="he">א</span> tends to quiesce in certain situations
        * SQiN eM Levy reject Dagesh when they have a Sheva
    * As we progress in Unit III, we will learn that other weak letters drop entirely like the <span class="he">נ</span> does, or otherwise behave differently
* One important caveat is that a verb may have a weak letter that causes deviation in one stem or conjugations but not in others
    * For example, <span class="he">ר</span> is only weak in forms that try to put a Dagesh Forte in it
    * 1נ (a verb with $R_1 = נ$ ) wants to assimilate whenever it has a Silent Sheva
        * Because this never happens to $R_1$ in the Qal Perfect, 1נ is said to be "strong" in the Qal Perfect
        * In the Qal IMPERFECT,  $R_1$ takes a Silent Sheva in the strong paradigm; this means 1נ verbs are said to be "weak" in that conjugation

> We classify weak verbs by their problem letter
 
* **3נ**, "third Nun," means that $R_3$ is <span class="he">נ</span>, as in <span class="he">זקן</span>
* **3ת**, "third Tav," means that $R_3$ is <span class="he">ת</span>, as in <span class="he">ברת</span>
* **1G**, "first guttural," means that $R_1$ is a guttural, as in <span class="he">אמר</span>
* **2G**, "second guttural," means that $R_2$ is a guttural, as in <span class="he">בחר</span>
* We can't simply say "3G" for any $R_3$ guttural because it turns out that <span class="he">א</span> and <span class="he">ה</span> each behave differently
    * Early in the course, we mentioned <span class="he">ר</span> is our "sometimes" guttural because it rejects the Dagesh Forte but accepts Vocal Sheva
    * Verbs with $R_1$ or $R_2$ of <span class="he">ר</span> will be included in 1G or 2G weak verbs when that Stem requires a Dagesh Forte
* **3עח**, "third Chet/Ayin," means that $R_3$ is <span class="he">ע</span> or <span class="he">ח</span>, as in <span class="he">מנע</span> <span class="he">לקח</span>
* **3א**, "third Aleph," means that $R_3$ is <span class="he">א</span>, as in <span class="he">מצא</span>
* **3ה**, "third Hei," means that $R_3$ is the vowel Qamets+Hei, as in <span class="he">בנה</span>
* **Geminate** - $R_2$ = $R_3$ <span class="he">סבב</span>
* **Biconsonantal** (also called Hollow) - $R_2$ is a vowel letter <span class="he">בוֹא</span> <span class="he">שִֹים</span> <span class="he">קוּם</span>
    * Biconsonantal verbs are the exception to Lexical form = QP3ms
* **Doubly Weak** is any combination of two (or three) weak letters, as in <span class="he">עַלָה</span>, which is a combination of **1G** and **3ה**
    * It is possible for all three root consonants to be weak, but we still call this class "Doubly Weak" (not "triply weak")

* The good news is when Hebrew verbs are weak, the behavior is usually predictable
* ***In Units I and II, you have already learned almost every behavior change we will encounter with weak verbs***
* It will just be a matter of applying that which you already learned to verbs
:::

* Weak verbs may take a little more thought, but overall they are nothing to be concerned about
* The better you know your _vocabulary_ and the _strong_ verb paradigms, the easier the _weak_ verbs will be

:::

* Older Hebrew Grammars focused on memorizing dozens of verb paradigm charts
    * Students had to memorize many different stems, conjugations, as well as strong and weak verb paradigms in those conjugations
* In this course, you will memorize only a handful of paradigms in the Qal Stem
* From here, we will be on a quest for pattern recognition
* Think of it like this: instead of taking a traditional approach to learning a language by brute-force, rote memorization, we are going to take more of a mathematical approach
    * A mathematician doesn't brute-force memorize the solution to every possible problem
    * She or he uses a series of formulas and plugs the specifics into the most appropriate formula for the situation
    * For example, consider the formula for the area of a square: $Area = S^2$ - the length of one of its sides multiplied by itself
    * Studying Hebrew the old way would require you to memorize the areas of hundreds of different squares
    * It is much simpler to memorize the formula
    * Then when you encounter a square that has a side $S = 5$, you can use the formula: $5^2$ to get the answer of $Area = 25$
    * If the next square you encounter has $S = 3$, you can use the same formula to get the answer $9$.
* You will begin to see things in a special $formula font$ - we will use $this font$ when there are consistent patterns
    * For example, whenever you see $Pre =$, this tells you that the verb has a specific combination of prefixes/preformative letters, vowels, and possibly Dagesh Forte marks that are characteristic of that verb class

* This was a lot of information to be sure
    * For the most part, this was simply the introduction - "student, meet Hebrew Verb"
    * As we said earlier, just absorb as much as you can for now
    * You will get to know each other much better in the subsequent lessons

> As we move through the course, we will complete a worksheet to compare verb stems

* By the end of the course, your table will look similar to this


```{r, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/34_stemcomp.png")
```

* The marks in RED are the distinctive $Pre$ patterns for the strong verbs in that stem/conjugation
    * Notice how each $Pre$ is unique!  This is your key to unlocking Hebrew Verbs!
* The vowels in BLUE and the "formula" in the last column are the $V_S$ patterns for that stem/conjugation
    * You can note that for the Qal stem, the perfect has a stem vowel of Patach, this is represented by the $A$ on the left side of the $V_S$ formula
    * The imperfect has a stem vowel of Holem.  The is the $\bar O$ on the right side
* You do not need to do anything with this table right now - we only want to show you how this relatively simple series of patterns will help you unlock the meaning of the Bible

שְׁמַע בְּנִי מוּסַר אָבִיךָ וְאַל-תִּטֹּשׁ תּוֹרַת אִמֶּך כִּי לִוְיַת חֵן הֵם לְרֹאשֶׁךָ וַעֲנָקִים לְגַרְגְּרֹתֶך 
 (1:8-9)

.בְּנִי תּוֹרָתִי אַל-תִּשְׁכָּח וּמִצְו‍ֹתַי יִצֹּר לִבֶּךָ כִּי אֹרֶךְ יָמִים וּשְׁנוֹת חַיִּים    וְשָׁלוֹם יוֹסִיפוּ לָךְ  
 (3:1-2)

חֶסֶד וֶאֱמֶת אַל-יַעַזְבֻךָ. קָשְׁרֵם עַל-גַּרְגְּרוֹתֶיךָ כָּתְבֵם עַל-לוּחַ לִבֶּךָ. וּמְצָא-חֵן וְשֵׂכֶל-טוֹב בְּעֵינֵי אֱלֹהִים וְאָדָם.
 (3:3-4)

בְּטַח אֶל-יְהוָה בְּכָל-לִבֶּךָ וְאֶל-בִּינָתְךָ אַל-תִּשָּׁעֵן. בְּכָל-דְּרָכֶיךָ דָעֵהוּ וְהוּא יְיַשֵּׁר אֹרְחֹתֶיך
 (3:5-6)

מִשְׁלֵי שְׁלֹמֹה. בֵּן חָכָם יְשַׂמַּח-אָב וּבֵן כְּסִיל תּוּגַת אִמּוֹ
 (10:1)

 בְּרָכוֹת לְרֹאשׁ צַדִּיק וּפִי רְשָׁעִים יְכַסֶּה חָמָס
 (10:6)

זֵכֶר צַדִּיק לִבְרָכָה וְשֵׁם רְשָׁעִים יִרְקָב
 (10:7)

מְקוֹר חַיִּים פִּי צַדִּיק וּפִי רְשָׁעִים יְכַסֶּה חָמָס
 (10:11)

שִׂנְאָה תְּעֹרֵר מְדָנִים וְעַל כָּל-פְּשָׁעִים תְּכַסֶּה אַהֲבָה
 (10:12)

בְּרֹב דְּבָרִים לֹא יֶחְדַּל-פָּשַׁע וְחוֹשֵׂךְ שְׂפָתָיו מַשְׂכִּיל
 (10:19)

שִׂפְתֵי צַדִּיק יִרְעוּ רַבִּים וֶאֱוִילִים בַּחֲסַר-לֵב יָמוּתוּ
 (10:21)

בִּרְכַּת יְהוָה הִיא תַעֲשִׁיר וְלֹא-יוֹסִף עֶצֶב עִמָּהּ
  (10:22)

כִּשְׂחוֹק לִכְסִיל עֲשׂוֹת זִמָּה וְחָכְמָה לְאִישׁ תְּבוּנָה
  (10:23)

מְגוֹרַת רָשָׁע הִיא תְבוֹאֶנּוּ וְתַאֲוַת צַדִּיקִים יִתֵּן
 (10:24)

כַּעֲבוֹר סוּפָה וְאֵין רָשָׁע וְצַדִּיק יְסוֹד עוֹלָם
 (10:25)

בְּבִרְכַּת יְשָׁרִים תָּרוּם קָרֶת וּבְפִי רְשָׁעִים תֵּהָרֵס
 (11:11)

הוֹלֵךְ רָכִיל מְגַלֶּה-סּוֹד וְנֶאֱמַן-רוּחַ מְכַסֶּה דָבָר
  (11:13)

אֵשֶׁת-חֵן תִּתְמֹךְ כָּבוֹד וְעָרִיצִים יִתְמְכוּ-עֹשֶׁר
 (11:16)

 נֶזֶם זָהָב בְּאַף חֲזִיר אִשָּׁה יָפָה וְסָרַת טָעַם
 (11:22)
