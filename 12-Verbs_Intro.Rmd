> Hebrew is a verbal, action-oriented language.  Now that we have concluded our discussion on nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and prepositions, we will now focus on verbs.

Around 70% of Hebrew verbs are in what we call the Qal stem, so we will spend Lessons 13-22 (in other words, Unit III) learning that stem inside and out.  Qal verbs represent "simple action", or active voice with a simple unnuanced type of action.^[The derived stems are different combinations of "voice" (active, passive, or reflexive) and "action" (simple or causative)]

Our quest is to translate accurately.  To do this, we must identify the root, stem, conjugation, person, gender, and number of verbs. This Lesson will provide a detailed introduction to the verb system as a whole and some general conventions.

You might notice there are a lot of sections in this lesson.  Most of these tend to be short introductions.  "Hebrew verbs, meet student.  Student, this are Hebrew verbs."  Frequently, we will take a concept you already learned in Units I and II, then modify it slightly to apply it to verbs.

*But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness . . . (1 Kings 19:4)*

As we begin a long stretch in Hebrew Verbs, at times, you may feel as exhausted, dry, and isolated as if you were Elijah (the subject of 1 Kings 19:4) driven into the wilderness.  

In these times, we must depend on God to sustain us.  It is times like these where God can pour into us and prepare us for our next adventure.  Moses, Elijah, John the Immerser, and several others all had their time in the Wilderness that God used to mold them as servant-leaders.  Of course, we can point to Yeshua himself and his time in the wilderness at the beginning of his ministry.  Embrace the wilderness!

"I advise beginners not to perplex themselves about any rule that at first view seems difficult, which will be of great advantage to carry on their design in the knowledge of this Primitive Tongue with success."  

-Judah Monis, on the back of the title page of his Hebrew Grammar, published in 1735.

* As Izzy mentions in the video we just watched, Hebrew grammars for the past several centuries have used the verb <span class="he">קטל</span> as what is called the "paradigm verb"
* <span class="he">קטל</span> is meant to represent _ANY_ "strong" verb (we'll discuss strong and weak verbs later in this Lesson)
* What makes <span class="he">קטל</span> awkward is the word means "to kill"
* As we go through this course, remember that the actual translation of <span class="he">קטל</span> is not material to our purposes
* In this respect, it is similar to a math formula
    * In $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, the letters "a", "b", and "c" have no direct, literal meaning
    * In the Pythagorean formula above, "a", "b", and "c" are meant to represent the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle
* We encourage you to think of <span class="he">קטל</span> the same way
    * The letters <span class="he">.ק.ט.ל</span> are just variable or placeholder letters that are part of a formula with a larger purpose than the direct, literal meaning
    * Also, like Izzy says, we can always think of <span class="he">קטל</span> as "killing" sin, bad habits, or things that can interfere in our relationship with the Holy One

* A _Root_ is the set of consonants on which a verb (and often nouns) are based
* The majority of verbs have three _root consonants_ from which the other words are derived.
* Consider the root <span class="he">מלך</span>; the graphic below lists just a few of the nouns and verbs that derive from this single root

* Back in Lesson 4, we discussed the difference between "inflecting" and "parsing"
* Inflecting is when we take a verb root such as <span class="he">מלך</span> and transform it by adding vowels, prefixes or suffixes to generate a specific form with a unique meaning
    * For example, if you were told to inflect <span class="he">מלך</span> into Qal Perfect first-person, common singular (QP1cs), you would provide "<span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span>"
* As we said back in Lesson 4, no part of reading the Hebrew Bible requires you to inflect
* Parsing can be thought of as going in the reverse direction
    * Say you encounter a verb such as "<span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span>"
    * In time, you will be able to determine that <span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span> is the QP1cs form of <span class="he">מלך</span>, and means "I ruled" or "I was king"
* To accurately translate the Hebrew you read in Scripture, you **will** be doing a lot of parsing

* The inflected person, gender, and number refer to the _subject_ of the verb
    * Pronominal suffixes are used to denote the object of the verb.  We will study these in Lesson 19
* Person, Gender, and Number for verbs are the same as for nouns
    * Gender
        * Male, female, or common
        * "Common" gender is for verb forms that could be either M or F; In Hebrew, as in English, the words for "I" and "we" are Common (i.e., there is not a masculine form of "I" and a separate feminine form of "I")
    * Person
        * 1st person is the speaker - "I/we sat"
        * 2nd person is the person being spoken to - "you sat"
        * 3rd person is anyone (or any_thing_) else - "he/she/it/they sat"
    * Number is either singular or plural - there are no dual verb forms

When parsing, it is standard to use parsing code "3ms" to mean "third person, masculine, singular."

*  As a convention, many Hebrew grammars label the three root letters $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$^[Older Hebrew grammars, including "Essentials of Biblical Hebrew" available in the holylanguage.com resource library, refer to these as "Pe", "Ayin" and "Lamed" positions, from the verb פעל. ].

* Also important to know is the _Lexical Form_ 
* The _lexical form_ is how you would locate the word in a dictionary
* As Izzy discussed in the introductory video, the lexical/dictionary form for verbs is almost always the Qal Perfect 3rd Person Masculine Singular.
* For the verb <span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span> (I was king):
    * The _root_ is <span class="he">מלך</span> (no vowels)
    * The _lexical form_ is <span class="he">מָלַךְ</span> (take the _root_ and inflect it as QP3ms form)

* While many dictionaries would consider "preformative" synonymous with "prefix" and "sufformative" synonymous with "suffix", Hebrew grammars often use the terms "preformative" and "sufformative" exclusively for verbs
* A verbal _preformative_ (if any) goes before $R_1$ and a _sufformative_ (if any) goes after $R_3$
    * A sufformative can also be referred to as an _afformative_ 
* Any _prefix_ such as the interrogative particle, or (commonly) the conjunction vav, goes _before_ the preformative
* Any _suffix_, such as a pronominal suffix, goes _after_ the sufformative
* For the verb <span class="he">קָטַ֫לְתִּי</span>
    * The sufformative is <span class="he">תִּי</span> 
    * There is no preformative 
    * There is no prefix or suffix
* For the verb <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>
    * The preformative is <span class="he">יִ </span>
    * The sufformative is <span class="he"> וּ</span>
    * There is no prefix or suffix
* For the verb <span class="he">יִקְטְל֫וּהָ</span>
    * The preformative is <span class="he">יִ</span>
    * The sufformative is <span class="he">וּ</span>
    * The pronominal suffix is <span class="he">הָ</span>
* The **root** for all three words is <span class="he">מלך</span>, or sometimes styled <span class="he">מ.ל.ך.</span>

* Identifying a verbal vowel's position is necessary to determine the Verbal Root and the Stem
* Similar to our shorthand for the root consonants, we use $V_P$ (the vowel with the prefix or preformative immediately before $R_1$), $V_1$ and $V_2$ - the vowels with $R_1$ and $R_2$, and $V_S$, which is what is called the _stem_ vowel
    * The $V_S$ vowel is usually the same as the $V_2$ vowel, but can be the $V_1$ vowel in certain situations
    * The vowel associated with $R_3$ turns out to be less important, so we do not need to identify this
* For the verb <span class="he">יִקְטְל֫וּהָ</span>
    * $V_P = I$ (remember I is shorthand for Hireq)
    * $V_1 = \ :$ (Silent Sheva)
    * $V_2$/$V_S = ə$ (Vocal Sheva)
    * Note: while we have said Silent Sheva is technically not a vowel, it is occupying the $R_1$ vowel position.  For this purpose, it is acceptable to say $V_1 = \ :$.

::: {.box .caution}
* While $V_P$ is the prefix or preformative vowel, $V_S$ is NOT the suffix or sufformative vowel
* $V_S$ is the STEM vowel, which is usually but not always $V_2$

* The verb __stem__ affects the meaning of the verb itself
* At a basic level, the stem provides the _type of action_ (simple, causative, intensive) and the _voice_ (active or passive)
* The _Qal_ stem is the basic or simple verb stem.  All other stems are derived from Qal

1. _Qal_ - Active (versus passive) voice and a simple type of action (without nuance) - “he broke the vase”
    * Parsing code: Q
2. _Niphal_ - Passive or reflexive voice with a simple action - “the vase was broken”
    * Interestingly in English, many translations of Niphal verbs are still active voice
    * For example, a fair translation of "he was seen" might be "he appeared"
    * Parsing code: N
3. _Piel_ - Active/Cause a state (or intensive^[Whether Piel is "intensive" is a matter of debate among Hebrew scholars.] - “he shattered the vase”
    * Parsing code: D (the Piel paradigm has a Daghesh Forte in $R_2$ - the D stands for "doubling Daghesh")
4. _Pual_ - Passive/Cause a state (or intensive) - “the vase was shattered”
    * Parsing code: Dp (passive of the Piel (D))
5. _Hiphil_ - Active/Cause an action - “he caused the vase to be broken”
    * Parsing code: H
6. _Hophal_ - Passive/Cause an action - “the vase was caused to be broken”
    * Parsing code: Hp (passive of the Hiphil (H))
7. _Hitpael_ - Reflexive/Cause a state (or intensive) - “he caused himself to be holy"
    * Parsing code: tD (very similar to Piel (D) and has a ת in every preformative form)

We'll explain the "Parsing codes" in a few sections

* While the stem provides the overall meaning, the _conjugation_ provides additional descriptive information needed for translation
* Strictly speaking, Hebrew does not have past, present, future, tense, as with English
    * Instead, the easiest way of thinking about it is that Hebrew has complete vs. incomplete action
    * Perfect is completed action
    * Imperfect is incomplete action
* Like English, Hebrew also has command (called Imperative), Volitional (called Cohortative and Jussive), Infinitive, and Participle conjugations

* At this stage of your quest, you are getting hit with a lot of new concept and terms
* Remember the lesson points are where you get introduced to the material; the activities are where you will learn the material
* Be patient and soak it in
:::



1. The _Perfect_ conjugation describes completed action, whether in the past, present, or future
    * Most often, we translate this as English past tense - "She went"
    * Verbs that describe a state of being as well an action that is completed in the future will be in the Perfect conjugation
    * Parsing code: P
2. The _Imperfect_ conjugation describes an incomplete action, whether in the past, present, or future
    * Most often, we translate this as English future tense - "She will go"
    * Verbs that describe an incomplete process or incomplete action, even if that action is in the past, will tend to be in the Imperfect conjugation
    * Parsing code: I
3. The _Imperative_ 2nd person Volitional - a command: "Go!"
    * Parsing code: M
4. The _Cohortative_ 1st Person Volitional - wish, purpose: "I should go"^[Some grammars classify "Corhortative" and "Jussive" as "Verb Moods" and the remaining as "Verb Tenses."].
    * Parsing code: C
5. The _Jussive_ 3rd Person Volitional - conjugation is similar to the Imperative - "He should go."
    * Parsing code: J
6. The _Infinitive Construct_ Verbal Noun -  "to go", or a verbal noun as in, "going"
    * Parsing code: ∞
7. The _Infinitive Absolute_ Verbal Noun - special uses, less common and has no direct equivalent in English
    * Parsing code: A
8. The _Participle_ - Verbal adjective - "runner," "one who runs"
    * Parsing code: Pt
    
    
::: {.box .info}

Vav prefix

* Some grammars identify three other forms, each with a Vav prefix, as additional conjugations/tenses:
    * Perfect + Vav
    * Imperfect + Vav
    * Imperfect Vav Consecutive 
* We will discuss these forms further in Lesson 17

* As we get into each stem, there will be separate chapters devoted to strong and week verbs
* Therefore, it will be useful for you to know what we mean by these terms
* Each conjugation will have a basic paradigm that prescribes vowels, accents, preformatives, and sufformatives for each PGN
* Strong verbs will follow this paradigm, so we will call this the "**strong verb paradigm**"
* Weak verbs will have one or more weak letters that result in some deviation from the paradigm
    * For example the first video by Izzy, he mentioned how the נ in <span class="he">נתן</span> can disappear in certain forms
    * This is because נ is a weak letter
* Strong verbs are "regular," and weak verbs are "irregular"
* The next two pages list some of the major weak categories

* A verb may have one such letter that causes deviation in one stem or conjugations but not in others
    * ר is only weak in forms that try to put a Dagesh Forte in it
    * 1נ (a verb with $R_1 = נ$ ) wants to assimilate whenever it has a Silent Sheva
        * Because this never happens to $R_1$ in the Qal Perfect, 1נ is said to be "strong" in the Qal Perfect
        * In the Qal IMPERFECT,  $R_1$ takes a Silent Sheva in the strong paradigm; this means 1נ verbs are said to be "weak" in that conjugation

* We classify weak verbs by their problem letter
    * 3נ, "third Nun," means that $R_3$ is נ, as in <span class="he">זקן</span>
    * 3ת, "third Tav," means that $R_3$ is ת, as in <span class="he">ברת</span>
    * 1G, "first guttural," means that $R_1$ is a guttural, as in <span class="he">אמר</span>
    * 2G, "second guttural," means that $R_2$ is a guttural, as in <span class="he">בחר</span>
    * We can't simply say "3G" for any $R_3$ guttural because it turns out that א and ה each behave differently
        * 3עח, "third Chet/Ayin," means that $R_3$ is ע or ח, as in <span class="he">מנע</span> <span class="he">לקח</span>
        * 3א, "third Aleph," means that $R_3$ is א, as in <span class="he">מצא</span>
        * 3ה, "third Hei," means that $R_3$ is the vowel Qamets+Hei, as in <span class="he">בנה</span>
    * Geminate - $R_2$ = $R_3$ <span class="he">סבב</span>
    * Biconsonantal (also called Hollow) - $R_2$ is a vowel letter <span class="he">בוֹא</span> <span class="he">שִֹים</span> <span class="he">קוּם</span>
        * Biconsonantal verbs are the exception to Lexical form = QP3ms - we'll discuss in Section 14.13
    * Doubly Weak is any combination of two (or three) weak letters, as in <span class="he">עַלָה</span>

If a verb has three weak letters, we still refer to it as "doubly weak" (not "triply weak")

* The good news is when Hebrew verbs are weak, the behavior is usually predictable
* In fact, you have already learned almost every behavior change we will encounter with weak verbs
    * For example, you already know that Gutturals reject Vocal Sheva and the Daghesh Forte
    * It will just be a matter of applying that which you already know to a new area
* Weak verbs may take a little more thought, but overall they are nothing to be concerned about
* The better you know your _vocabulary_ and the _strong_ verb paradigms, the easier the _weak_ verbs will be

* Older Hebrew Grammars focused on memorizing dozens of verb paradigm charts
    * Students had to memorize many different stems, conjugations, as well as strong and weak verb paradigms in those conjugations
* In this course, you will memorize only a handful of paradigms in the Qal Stem
* From here, we will be on a quest for pattern recognition
* Think of it like this: instead of taking a traditional approach to learning a language by brute-force, rote memorization, we are going to take more of a mathematical approach
    * A mathematician doesn't brute-force memorize the solution to every possible problem
    * She or he uses a series of formulas and plugs the specifics into the most appropriate formula for the situation
    * For example, consider the formula for the area of a square: $Area = S^2$ - the length of one of its sides multiplied by itself
    * Studying Hebrew the old way would require you to memorize the areas of hundreds of different squares
    * It is much simpler to memorize the formula
    * Then when you encounter a square that has a side $S = 5$, you can use the formula: $5^2$ to get the answer of $Area = 25$
    * If the next square you encounter has $S = 3$, you can use the same formula to get the answer $9$.
* You will begin to see things in a special $formula font$ - we will use $this font$ when there are consistent patterns
    * For example, whenever you see $Pre =$, this tells you that the verb has a specific combination of prefixes/preformative letters, vowels, and possibly Dagesh Forte marks that are characteristic of that verb class

* As we move through the course, we will build a table to compare verb stems
* At the end of the course, your table will look like this:

```{r, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/34_stemcomp.png")
```

* The marks in RED are the distinctive $Pre$ patterns for the strong verbs in that stem/conjugation
* The vowels in BLUE and the "formula" in the last column are the $V_S$ patterns for that stem/conjugation
    * You can note that for the Qal stem, the perfect has a stem vowel of Patach, this is represented by the $A$ on the left side of the $V_S$ formula
    * The imperfect has a stem vowel of Holem.  The is the $\bar O$ on the right side
* You do not need to do anything with this table right now - we only want to show you how this relatively simple series of patterns will help you unlock the meaning of the Bible
