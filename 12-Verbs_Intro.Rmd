# Introduction to Hebrew Verbs

Hebrew is a verbal, action-oriented language.  Now that we have concluded our discussion on nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and prepositions, we will now turn our focus to verbs.

Around 70% of Hebrew verbs are in what we call the Qal stem, so we will spend Lessons 13-22 learning that stem inside and out.  Qal verbs represents simple action. 

Our quest is to translate accurately.  To do this, we must identify the root, stem, conjugation, person, gender, and number of verbs. This Lesson will provide a brief introduction to the verb system as a whole and some general conventions.

*But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness . . . (1 Kings 19:4)*

As we begin a long stretch in Hebrew Verbs, at times, you may feel as exhausted, dry, and isolated as if you were Elijah (the subject of 1 Kings 19:4) driven into the wilderness.  

In these times, we must depend on God to sustain us.  It is times like these where God can pour into us and prepare us for our next adventure.  Moses, Elijah, John the Immerser, and several others all had their time in the Wilderness that God used to mold them as servant-leaders.  Of course, we can point to Yeshua himself and his time in the wilderness at the beginning of his ministry.  Embrace the wilderness!

"I advise beginners not to perplex themselves about any rule that at first view seems difficult, which will be of great advantage to carry on their design in the knowledge of this Primitive Tongue with success."  

-Judah Monis, on the back of the title page of his Hebrew Grammar, published in 1735. 

:::
## A note on the paradigm strong verb <span class="he">קטל</span>

* As Izzy mentions in the video we just viewed, Hebrew grammars for the past several centuries have used the verb <span class="he">קטל</span> as what is called the "paradigm verb"
* <span class="he">קטל</span> is meant to represent _ANY_ strong verb (we'll discuss strong and weak verbs later in this Lesson)
* What makes <span class="he">קטל</span> awkward is the word means "to kill"
* As we go through this course, remember that the actual translation of <span class="he">קטל</span> is not material to our purposes
* In this respect, it is similar to a math formula
    * In $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, the letters "a", "b", and "c" have no direct, literal meaning
    * In the Pythagorean formula above, "a", "b", and "c" are meant to represent the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle
* We encourage you to think of <span class="he">קטל</span> the same way - they are just variable or placeholder letters that are part of a formula with a larger purpose than the direct, literal meaning
    * Also, like Izzy says, we can always think of <span class="he">קטל</span> as "killing" sin, bad habits, or things that can interfere in our relationship with the Holy One.
    
## The Verbal Root

* A _Root_ is the set of consonants on which a verb (and often nouns) are based
* The majority of verbs have three _root consonants_ from which the other words are derived.
* Consider the root <span class="he">מלך</span>; the graphic below lists just a few of the nouns and verbs that derive from this single root

```{r, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/12-verb-root.gif")
``` 
## Inflecting and Parsing Review

* Back in Lesson 4, we discussed the difference between "inflecting" and "parsing"
* Inflecting is when we take a root such as <span class="he">מלך</span> and transform it by adding vowels, prefixes or suffixes to generate a specific form with a unique meaning
    * For example, if you were told to inflect <span class="he">מלך</span> into Qal Perfect first person, common singular (QP1cs), you would provide "<span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span>"
* As we said back in Lesson 4, no part of reading the Hebrew Bible requires you to inflect
* Parsing can be thought of as going in the reverse direction
    * Say you encounter a verb such as "<span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span>"
    * In time, you will be able to determine that <span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span> is the QP1cs form of <span class="he">מלך</span>, and means "I ruled" or "I was king"
* To accurately translate the Hebrew you read in Scripture, you will be doing a lot of parsing

## Person, Gender, Number

* The inflected person, gender, and number refer to the _subject_ of the verb
    * Pronominal suffixes are used to denote the object of the verb.  We will study these in Lesson 19
* Person, Gender, and Number for verbs are the same as for nouns
    * "Common" gender is for verb forms that could be either M or F; In Hebrew, as in English, the words for "I" and "we" are Common (i.e., there is not a masculine form of "I" and a separate feminine form of "I")
    * Person
        * 1st person is the speaker - "I/we sat"
        * 2nd person is the person being spoken to - "you sat"
        * 3rd person is anyone else - "he/she/it/they sat"
    * Number is singular or plural - there are no dual verb forms
    
::: {.box .info}
When parsing, it is standard to use parsing code "3ms" to mean "third person, masculine, singular."
:::

## Verb nomenclature

*  As a convention, many Hebrew grammars label the three root letters $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$<small>^[<small>Older Hebrew grammars, including "Essentials of Biblical Hebrew" available in the holylanguage.com resource library, refer to these as "Pe", "Ayin" and "Lamed" positions, from the verb פעל. </small>]</small>.
* For the verb <span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span> (I was king):
    * The _root_ is <span class="he">מלך</span> (no vowels)
        * $R_1$ = מ
        * $R_2$ = ל
        * $R_3$ = ך

## Lexical form for Verbs

* Also important to know is the _Lexical Form_ 
* The _lexical form_ is how you would locate the word in a dictionary
* As Izzy discussed in the introductory video, the lexical/dictionary form for verbs is almost always the Qal Perfect 3rd Person Masculine Singular.
* For the verb <span class="he">מָלַכְתִּי</span> (I was king):
    * The _root_ is <span class="he">מלך</span> (no vowels)
    * The _lexical form_ is <span class="he">מָלַךְ</span> (take the _root_ and inflect it as QP3ms form)
        
## Preformatives, Sufformatives, Prefixes, and Suffixes

* While many dictionaries would consider "preformative" synonymous with "prefix" and "sufformative" synonymous with "suffix", Hebrew grammars often use the terms "preformative" and "sufformative" exclusively for verbs
* A verbal _preformative_ (if any) goes before $R_1$ and a _sufformative_ (if any) goes after $R_3$
    * A sufformative can also be referred to as an _afformative_ 
* Any _prefix_ such as the interrogative particle, or (commonly) the conjunction vav, goes _before_ the preformative
* Any _suffix_, such as a pronominal suffix, goes _after_ the sufformative
* For the verb <span class="he">קָטַ֫לְתִּי</span>
    * The sufformative is <span class="he">תִּי</span> 
    * There is no preformative 
    * There is no prefix or suffix
* For the verb <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>
    * The preformative is <span class="he">יִ </span>
    * The sufformative is <span class="he"> וּ</span>
    * There is no prefix or suffix
* For the verb <span class="he">יִקְטְל֫וּהָ</span>
    * The preformative is <span class="he">יִ</span>
    * The sufformative is <span class="he">וּ</span>
    * The pronominal suffix is <span class="he">הָ</span>

::: {.box .map}

On your quest to translate verbs, identifying preformatives and sufformatives on verbs is the key to accurate parsing.

:::

## Verbal Vowels

* Identifying a verbal vowel's position is necessary to determine the Verbal Root and the Stem
* Similar to our shorthand for the root consonants, we use $V_P$ - the vowel with the preformative, $V_1$ and $V_2$ - the vowels with $R_1$ and $R_2$, and $V_S$, which is what is called the __stem__ vowel
    * The $V_S$ is usually $V_2$ 
    * The vowel associated with $R_3$ turns out to be less important so we do not need to identify this
* For the verb <span class="he">יִקְטְל֫וּהָ</span>
    * $V_P = I$ (remember I is shorthand for Hireq)
    * $V_1$ is Silent Sheva
    * $V_2$/$V_S$ are Vocal Sheva
    * Note: while we have said Silent Sheva is technically not a vowel, it is occupying the vowel position of $R_1$ for this purpose, it is acceptable to say $V_1 = \ :$


## _Hebrew Quest_ Verb Stems Lecture

View this 8-minute overview video from _Hebrew Quest_ where Izzy provides a summary of the seven Hebrew verb stems. Note that the table Izzy uses has a slightly different layout from the table used later in this lesson, but both convey the same information.

## The Seven Hebrew Verb Stems


* The verb __stem__ affects the meaning of the verb itself
* At a basic level, the stem provides the _type of action_ (simple, causative, intensive) and the _voice_ (active or passive)
* The _Qal_ stem is the basic or simple verb stem.  All other stems are derived from Qal

1. _Qal_ - Active (versus passive) voice and a simple type of action (without nuance) - “he broke the vase”
    * Parsing code: Q
2. _Niphal_ - Passive or reflexive voice with a simple action - “the vase was broken”
    * Interestingly in English, many translations of Niphal verbs are still active voice
    * For example, a fair translation of "he was seen" might be "he appeared"
    * Parsing code: N
3. _Piel_ - Active/intensive - “he smashed the vase”
    * Parsing code: D (the Piel paradigm has a Daghesh Forte in $R_2$ - the D stands for "doubling Daghesh")
4. _Pual_ - Passive/intensive - “the vase was shattered”
    * Parsing code: Dp (passive of the Piel (D))
5. _Hiphil_ - Active/Causative - “he caused the vase to be broken”
    * Parsing code: H
6. _Hophal_ - Passive/Causative - “the vase was caused to be broken”
    * Parsing code: Hp (passive of the Hiphil (H))
7. _Hitpael_ - Reflexive/Intensive - “he caused himself to be holy"
    * Parsing code: tD (very similar to Piel (D) and has a ת in every preformative form)

We'll explain the "Parsing codes" in a few sections 



## The Seven Stems: Summary Table

* There is scholarly debate about the table below
* Hebrew verbs can have any one of several nuanced meanings depending on the context
* The table provides a good starting place, but it is not the "final word" on verb stems
* We will discuss these nuances as we introduce each stem
    
| |Active Voice| Passive Voice | Reflexive Voice
|:- |:- |:- |:-
Simple Action	| Qal | Niphal | (Niphal)
Cause a State	| Piel | Pual | Hitpael
Cause an Action	|Hiphil | Hophal


## Conjugation

* While the stem provides the overall meaning, the _conjugation_ provides additional descriptive information needed for translation
* Strictly speaking, Hebrew does not have past, present, future, tense, as with English
    * Instead, the easiest way of thinking about it is that Hebrew has complete vs. incomplete action
* Like English, Hebrew also has command (called Imperative), infinitive, and participle conjugations


## The Eight Basic Conjugations

1. The _Perfect_ conjugation describes completed action, whether in the past, present, or future
    * Most often, we translate this as English past tense - "She went"
    * Verbs that describe a state of being as well an action that is completed in the future will be in the Perfect conjugation
    * Parsing code: P
2. The _Imperfect_ conjugation describes an incomplete action, whether in the past, present, or future
    * Most often, we translate this as English future tense - "She will go"
    * Verbs that describe an incomplete process or incomplete action, even if that action is in the past, will tend to be in the Imperfect conjugation
    * Parsing code: I
3. The _Imperative_ 2nd person Volitional - a command: "Go!"
    * Parsing code: M
4. The _Cohortative_ 1st Person Volitional - wish, purpose: "I should go"<small>^[<small>Some grammars classify "Corhortative" and "Jussive" as "Verb Moods" and the remaining as "Verb Tenses."</small>]</small>.
    * Parsing code: C
5. The _Jussive_ 3rd Person Volitional - conjugation is similar to the Imperative - "He should go."
    * Parsing code: J
6. The _Infinitive Construct_ Verbal Noun -  "to go", or a verbal noun as in, "going"
    * Parsing code: ∞
7. The _Infinitive Absolute_ Verbal Noun - special uses, less common and has no direct equivalent in English
    * Parsing code: A
8. The _Participle_ - Verbal adjective - "runner," "one who runs"
    * Parsing code: Pt
    
    
::: {.box .info}

Vav prefix

* Some grammars identify three other forms, each with a Vav prefix, as additional conjugations/tenses:
    * Perfect + Vav
    * Imperfect + Vav
    * Imperfect Vav Consecutive 
* We will discuss these forms further in Lesson 17

:::

## Finite vs. Non-Finite Conjugations

* _FINITE_ verbs have "person"
    * Perfect, Imperfect, Imperative, Cohortative, Jussive
* _NON-FINITE_ verbs do NOT have "person"
    * Infinitive Construct, Infinitive Absolute, Participle
    * Only Participles have Gender and Number


## Parsing

* As we stated above, parsing is the process of breaking down a verb into its component parts
* The following should be included when parsing a verb (as applicable):
    * Stem
    * Conjugation
    * Person (only for finite)
    * Gender (except for Infinitive forms)
    * Number (except for Infinitive forms)
    * Either the _Root_ form or the _Lexical_ form

    
## Parsing Codes

* Constantly writing the full parsing descriptions, such as "Hitpael Cohortative, Third Person, Masculine Plural" would become tedious
* Therefore, many Hebrew grammarians use what is called "parsing code"  
* Unfortunately, the terminology for morphology is not standardized
* We will be using Dr. John Beckman's code as he has applied it to "Basics of Biblical Hebrew"
* Dr. Beckman's shorthand for the above would be "tDC3mp"
* For comparison, Logos software's code would be "VgI3MS-C"


## Strong and Weak Verbs

* As we get into each stem, there will be separate chapters devoted to strong and week verbs
* Therefore, it will be useful for you to know what we mean by these terms
* Each conjugation will have a basic paradigm that prescribes vowels, accents, preformatives, and sufformatives for each PGN
* Strong verbs will follow this paradigm, so we will call this the "strong verb paradigm"
* Weak verbs will have one or more weak letters that result in some deviation from the paradigm
    * For example the first video by Izzy, he mentioned how the נ in <span class="he">נתן</span> can disappear in certain forms
    * This is because נ is a weak letter
* Strong verbs are "regular" and weak verbs are "irregular"
* The next page lists some of the major weak categories

## Weak Verbs

* A weak verb has a root consonant that causes it to deviate from the strong-verb paradigm
* A verb may have one such letter that causes deviation in one stem or conjugations but not in others
    * ר is only weak in forms that try to put a Dagesh Forte in it
    * 1נ wants to assimilate whenever it has a Silent Sheva
        * Because this never happens to $R_1$ in the Qal Perfect, 1נ is strong in the Qal Perfect
        * We will learn this will happen in the imperfect, so 1נ is weak in that conjugation
        
## Weak Verb Classes

* We classify weak verbs by their problem letter
    * 3נ, "third Nun," means that $R_3$ is נ, as in <span class="he">זקן</span>
    * 3ת, "third Tav," means that $R_3$ is ת, as in <span class="he">ברת</span>
    * 1G, "first guttural," means that $R_1$ is a guttural, as in <span class="he">אמר</span>
    * 2G, "second guttural," means that $R_2$ is a guttural, as in <span class="he">בחר</span>
* We can't simply say "3G" for any $R_3$ guttural because it turns out that א and ה each behave differently
    * 3עח, "third Chet/Ayin," means that $R_3$ is ע or ח, as in <span class="he">מנע</span> <span class="he">לקח</span>
    * 3א, "third Aleph," means that $R_3$ is א, as in <span class="he">מצא</span>
    * 3ה, "third Hei," means that $R_3$ is the vowel Qamets+Hei, as in <span class="he">בנה</span>
    * Geminate - $R_2$ = $R_3$ <span class="he">סבב</span>
    * Biconsonantal (also called Hollow) - $R_2$ is a vowel letter <span class="he">בוֹא</span> <span class="he">שִׁים</span>* <span class="he">קוּם</span>*
    * Doubly Weak is any combination of two (or three) weak letters, as in <span class="he">עַלָה</span>
    
## Weak Verbs Are Predictable

* The good news is when Hebrew verbs are weak, the behavior is usually predictable
* In fact, you have already learned almost every behavior change we will encounter with weak verbs
    * For example, you already know that Gutturals reject Vocal Sheva and the Daghesh Forte
    * It will just be a matter of applying that which you already know to a new area
* Weak verbs may take a little more thought, but overall they are nothing to be concerned about
* The better you know your _vocabulary_ and the _strong_ verb paradigms, the easier the _weak_ verbs will be

## Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is a Quest for RECOGNITION, NOT RECALL

* Older Hebrew Grammars focused on memorizing dozens of verb paradigm charts
* Students had to memorize many different stems, conjugations, as well as strong and weak verb paradigms in those conjugations
* In this course, you will memorize only a handful of paradigms in the Qal Stem
* From here we will be on a quest for pattern recognition
* Think of it like this: instead of taking a traditional approach to learning a language by brute-force, rote memorization, we are going to take more of a mathematical approach
    * A mathematician doesn't brute-force memorize the solution to every possible problem
    * She or he uses a series of formulas and plugs the specifics into the most appropriate formula for the situation
    * For example, consider the formula for the area of a square :$Area = S^2$ - the length of one of its sides multiplied by itself
    * Studying Hebrew the old way would require you to memorize the areas of hundreds of different squares
    * It is much simpler to memorize the formula, then when you encounter a square that has a side $s$ = 5, you can use the formula: $5^2$ to get the answer of $Area = 25$
* You will begin to see things in a special $formula font$ - we will use $this font$ when there are consistent patterns
    * For example, whenever you see $Pre =$, this tells you that the verb has a specific combination of prefixes/preformative letters, vowels, and possibly Dagesh Forte marks that are characteristic of that verb class
    
## Stem Comparison Table

* As we move through the course, we will build a table to compare stems
* At the end of the course, your table will look like this:

```{r, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/34_stemcomp.png")
```

* The marks in RED are the distinctive $Pre$ patterns for the strong verbs in that stem/conjugation
* The vowels in BLUE and the "formula" in the last column are the $V_S$ patterns for that stem/conjugation
* You do not need to do anything with this table right now - we only want to show you how this relatively simple series of patterns will help you unlock the meaning of the Bible
