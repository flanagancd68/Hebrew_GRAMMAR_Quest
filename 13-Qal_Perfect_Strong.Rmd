> Over 2/3 of all verbs in the Hebrew Bible are in the Qal stem.  To understand Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to translate Qal verbs.

While our focus is not on writing Biblical Hebrew, we need to be able to write the details on the Qal strong verb paradigms. This will make it easier to recognize Qal weak and non-Qal verbs.  This lesson will begin with the Perfect conjugation.

### <span class="he">לֹא־שָׁמְר֤וּ אֲבוֹתֵ֙ינוּ֙ אֶת־דְּבַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה </span> {-}

*Our fathers did not keep the word of Adonai (2 Chronicles 34:21)*

<span class="he">שָׁמַר</span> means to guard or keep, in the sense of obeying.  It is a verb that frequently occurs in the Hebrew Bible. 

In <span class="he">לֹא־שָׁמְרוּ</span>, the word <span class="he">לֹא</span> serves to negate the verb it precedes.  Literally, this might be "not they kept", but we would say "they did not keep" in English.

Every day, and frequently throughout each day, we have two choices.  We can keep His word, or we can ignore His word.  

Let us strive to have it be told of all of us, <span class="he">שָׁמְרוּ אֶת־דְּבַר יְהוָה </span>, "they KEPT the word of Adonai."

Simple Action	| __QAL__ | Niphal | (Niphal)
Cause a State	| Piel | Pual | Hitpael
Cause an Action	|Hiphil | Hophal

*  Remember this table is very high-level and perhaps over-simplified; but, it is a good starting place for understanding the meaning each stem
*  Qal is the primary Hebrew stem
*  The other six major stems are said to be "derived" from the Qal stem, hence the name "derived stems"

>In translating the Qal Perfect, we will most often use the simple English past tense

* For example, "she studied"
* It is commonly taught that the Hebrew perfect is equivalent to the English past tense
    * This is a generality; it is often true, but it is not always true
    * Other translations may be appropriate depending on the context
        * Present perfect: "she has studied"
        * Past perfect: "she had studied"
        * Future perfect: "she will have studied"
* Stative verbs describe a state of being; these verbs are also Perfect
    * English present is often a better translation: She is wise, she knows, she loves
    * English past might also be appropriate: she was wise
    * In a few sections, we will learn that in Hebrew, stative verbs are sometimes spelled differently
    
::: {.box .info}
The Hebrew perfect conjugation describes an action or a state of being as a whole, _not as a process_

I.e., "she was studying" is an incomplete process, but "she had studied" is completed action

> Preformatives and Sufformatives are unique verbal beginnings and endings that indicate person, gender, and number

* In Lesson 12, we introduced the concept of preformatives and sufformatives
* The Perfect has a set of "perfect sufformatives"
    * Only the 3ms does not have a perfect sufformative
    * We will learn the sufformatives for the remaining PGN forms in the next section
* The perfect sufformatives are the same across all verb stems, so what you learn for the Qal can be applied to the derived stems (good news!)
* The perfect does not have preformatives (more good news!)

A verb with no preformative, and a perfect sufformative will be diagnostic of a Perfect conjugation

> We want to learn the Qal Strong paradigms inside and out so we can learn to spot deviations in weak verbs and in other verb stems


1. Add perfect sufformative
2. Put a Sheva before the sufformative
3. Add a Dagesh Lene to <span class="he">ת</span> , since it is a <span class="he">בגד כפת</span> letter, when it follows a Sheva
4. \(V_S = A\) (Patach) in the Qal Perfect Strong paradigm
5. Accent $V_S$, if possible
6. $V _1 = \bar A$ in the Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm
7. Optionally, add a Metheg mark to denote $\bar A$ (Qamets) from $O$ (Qamets Hatuf)

> In 3FS and 3CP, this rule causes a Sheva to displace the expected Patach in $V_2$ (step 4)

* This is a general rule that results in a Sheva under $R_3$ or $R_2$
* This only applies to finite verbs (Perfect, Imperfect, Volitional)
* Take a look at the Qal Perfect Paradigm table again and note how there is a sheva next to the sufformative
* 3MS has no sufformative so it has no sheva
* 3CP and 3FS looks a little different because those sufformatives both start with a vowel
    * The <span class="he">ל</span> already has an associated vowel, Shureq (3CP)and Qamets+Hei (3FS)
    * A consonant cannot have more than one vowel
    * For these two PGN forms, since the Sheva can't go under $R_3$, it shifts to $R_2$ (and displaces the Patach in $V_2$)

The Sheva is rejected in the following circumstances:

* A Sheva does not replace an unchangeable long vowel
* A Sheva does not replace $V_1$ of the Qal Perfect (and only the Qal Perfect)
* When $R_3$ is <span class="he">א</span>, the <span class="he">א</span> quiesces (generally resulting in Compensatory Lengthening of $V_2$)

The Sheva may either be silent or vocal, depending on the rules we learned in Lesson 3

* For QP, $V_2$ _prefers_ Patach 
* For strong verbs, $V_S = V_2$
    * So we could either say "$V_S$ for Qal Perfect Strong equals Patach"
    * Or we could use formula shorthand and say, "Qal $V_S = A$", since "A" is our shorthand for a short A vowel, i.e., Patach
* In 3FS and 3CP, the Sheva of the perfect sufformative goes in $V_2$ and displaces the Patach

> Different conjugations may have different Stem Vowels.  There are formulas we will use to help us remember.

* As we progress through the verbs, each major stem will end up with a formula that looks something like this: 

$$V_{S} =  Î[A] \sim  Î(Ē)$$

* This is the Hiphil formula and is probably complete gibberish to you right now!
* As we get into Unit 4, this formula (in combination with the $Pre$ pattern) will save you hours of paradigm memorization of the derived stems
* You will only need to memorize the Qal paradigms, then apply this formula to the other stems
* So let's start to build this formula for the Qal:

$$V_{S} = A \sim$$

* In the formula, $A$ refers to Patach
* This formula is telling you that the Stem Vowel of the Perfect Conjugation _prefers_ Patach
    * P3FS and P3CP will be exceptions in all stems
    * Pronominal suffixes (Lesson 19) will also cause deviations
* The _Imperfect_ Stem Vowel will be to the right of the $\sim$ mark - we'll address this in Lesson 15

> The Qamets is wonderfully consistent in the Qal Perfect!

* There are other characteristics of the Qal perfect paradigm that will help us when we read the Bible
* $V_1 = \bar A$ (Qamets) almost always
* Exception: as we learned way back in this course, an unaccented long vowel in an open propretonic syllable will undergo propretonic reduction
    * When this happens, you will see a Vocal Sheva instead of Qamets
    * Because we can identify propretonic reduction, we will be able to deduce that $V_1$ used to be a long vowel - and if it's a Qal verb, you'll know it used to be a Qamets
* Study the chart below showing $V_1$
    * The vertical line in 3FS and 3CP is called a "metheg" and is used to distinguish $\bar A$ (Qamets) from $O$ (Qamets Hatuf) when followed by a Sheva
    * Note 2MP and 2FP have undergone propretonic reduction and have $ə$ (Vocal Sheva) instead of $\bar A$
    * When we get to Lesson 19 (Pronominal Suffixes), the Qamets will similarly reduce

> HGQ SHORTHAND: $Pre$ = Strong Form Diagnostic Word-initial Sequence

* Each of the stems/conjugations has a distinctive combination of consonants, vowels, and occasionally Dagesh Forte marks the first one or two syllables of a given verb
* This serves to make the strong form of the verb easy to differentiate from the other stems
* We will call this diagnostic sequence "$Pre$"
    * Saying "diagnostic word-initial sequence of consonants and vowels" would get tiresome!

    
::: {.box .map}
* Qal Perfect Strong $Pre =$ <span class="he">קָ</span>
:::
* <span class="he">ק</span> represents any strong letter as $R_1$ in a strong verb
* This means the distinctive word-initial sequence of a <u>Q</u>al <u>P</u>erfect verb is no prefix/preformative and a Qamets in $V_1$
* In other words, when a strong verb has no prefix/preformative, $R_1$ is any strong letter and $V_1 = \bar A$ (Qamets) it is nearly always a Qal Perfect conjugation
    * Thanks to propretonic reduction, the Qamets reduces to Vocal Sheva in 2MP/3MP
    * We will discuss weak letter deviations and how to work our way back to the strong verb paradigm in the next lesson

1. Add the perfect sufformatives (unless 3MS)
2. Put a Sheva before the sufformative 
    * 3fs/3cp - the Sheva can't go under $R_3$ because $R_3$ already has a vowel
        * A consonant can't have more than one vowel
        * For these forms, the Sheva goes under $R_2$
3. Add Dagesh Lene to <span class="he">תּ</span> that comes after any Sheva (as we would need to do for any <span class="he">בגד כפת</span> letter)
    * all 2nd person forms and 1cs
4. $V_S = A$ (Patach) in the Qal Perfect Strong paradigm
    * UNLESS $V_2$ is already a Sheva from step two
5. Accent $V_S$ 
    * Exception 1 - $V_2$ is reduced/Sheva
    * Exception 2 - there is a "heavy sufformative" that draws the accent (2MP/2FP)
6. $V_1 = \bar A$ (Qamets)
    * 2mp/2fp - the Qamets is then reduced to a Vocal Sheva because of propretonic reduction
7. OPTIONAL - Add a Metheg mark to $V_1$ 3fs/3cp

    * In <span class="he">יָדַ֥ע</span> , the $Pre$ combination is <span class="he">יָ</span>, so that fits Qal Perfect!
    * This word has no sufformative, which indicates 3MS
    * Based on this alone, we are almost assured this is QP3MS 
        * The lack of a preformative and a sufformative *could* be other Qal conjugations
        * The other conjugations will have different vowels
        * $V_1 = \bar A$ is diagnostic of Qal Perfect
    * Let's look for an additional confirmation
    * Qal Perfect, the $V_S = A$  
    * In <span class="he">יָדַ֥ע</span>, $V_S = A$ (<span class="he">דַ</span>) so we have another match
        * This is another indicator of Qal stem, Perfect conjugation (QP)
    * This combination of (lack of) preformatives, (lack of) sufformatives, and vowels can only be Qal Perfect 3MS (QP3ms) - he knows
    * As we said in the introduction to Unit 3, you will start to see the cantillation marks in words and passages
        * If you don't recognize a dot, dash, or line as a vowel, assume it is a cantillation mark

* <span class="he">שָׁמְר֤וּ</span>
    * $Pre =$ <span class="he">קָ</span> is diagnostic of Qal stem
    * <span class="he">שָׁמְר֤וּ</span> has <span class="he">שָׁ</span>
        * That matches!  $R_1= $ a strong consonant and $V_1 = \bar A$ 
    * We're typically expecting $V_2/V_S = A$ in the Qal.  
        * The Sheva is a clue that there might be an exception to a rule: 
        * In <span class="he">שָׁמְר֤וּ</span>, $V_2 = ə$
        * We know one of our rules is that the Perfect sufformative is preceded by a Sheva, but in the P3cp (and P3fs), the Sheva of the sufformative displaces the Patach $V_2$
* <span class="he">וּ</span> perfect sufformative = $P3cp$ conjugation
    * If we know our vocab, we also understand that the Lexical form is <span class="he">שָׁמַר</span>.
    * <span class="he">שָׁמְר֤וּ</span> is Qal Perfect 3cp (QP3cp) - they guarded/observed/kept/watched over
* As with <span class="he">זָכָ֑רְתְּ</span>, there are times where $V_S \not = A$ in the Qal Perfect
    * Stative verbs may have a different $V_S$, as we will discuss in a future section
    * Spelling variants may occur over the many hundreds of years the Tanach was written<small>^[<small>This is not unlike seeing "olde" or even "auld" on an English document from a few hundred years ago.  We know they both mean "old"</small>]</small>
    * If there is nothing otherwise to suggest that you are not looking at a Qal verb, go with a Qal translation unless/until proven otherwise

NAVIGATION TIP


As we will learn in Unit 4, when there are no other signs of a different stem, we can default to Qal; this is because Qal is the most common stem

> What makes a verb "weak" versus "strong" is when one or more letters cause a deviation from the strong verb paradigm; in most cases, you already know the behaviors of "weak" letters!  

* While the bulk of the discussion on weak verbs will be in Lesson 14, there are three weak forms we will introduce in this lesson: 
    * Words where $R_3$ = <span class="he">נ</span>, which we abbreviate as  or sometimes "3נ" (pronounced as, "third nun")
    * Words where $R_3$ = <span class="he">ת</span>, are "3ת"
* Additionally, there is a class called "Stative verbs" that describe a state of being as opposed to an action
    * In Hebrew, stative verbs are not necessarily considers "weak" unless they have a weak letter
    * Nonetheless, in the Qal stem, since stative verbs have $V_2 \not = A$, they do represent deviations from the strong verb paradigm; as such, they warrant additional discussion
    * While "stative" verbs may be a new concept, we have already discussed the tendency of <span class="he">ת</span> and <span class="he">נ</span> to assimilate under certain circumstances.  This is what happens when we encounter 3ת and 3נ verbs.

> A Dagesh Forte is your clue that something is different

* We mentioned above how a Sheva will be placed before a Finite sufformative (if possible)
* When <span class="he">ת</span> and <span class="he">נ</span> have a Silent Sheva, each may assimilate depending on the letter that follows
    * In other words, the verb will lose $R_3$ and a Dagesh Forte will be placed into the first letter of the sufformative
    * An $R_3$ of <span class="he">ת</span> with a Silent Sheva will only assimilate when the sufformative begins with ת
        * Not <span class="he">כָּרַ֫תְתָּ</span>*<small>^[<small>Remember, the * means the Hebrew word is an impossibility, but is shown for illustrative purposes</small>]</small> but <span class="he">כָּרַ֫תָּ</span>
        * Not <span class="he">כְּרַתְתֶּם</span>*, but <span class="he">כְּרַתֶּ֫ם</span>
        * IMPORTANT: Note how the Dagesh in the <span class="he">ת</span> shifts from a Lene to a Forte (because the Dagesh is now preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva)
            * This is your cue that something has changed, usually that a letter is missing
            * In theory, the root could be either <span class="he">כרן</span> or <span class="he">כרת</span>, but you already know <span class="he">כרת</span> from your vocabulary work (and there is no verb root <span class="he">כרן</span>)
    * An $R_3$ of <span class="he">נ</span> with a Silent Sheva will tend to assimilate to either <span class="he">נ</span> or <span class="he">ת</span>
        * <span class="he">נַתַן</span> is an extremely common 3נ verb meaning "to give"
        * Not <span class="he">נָתַ֫נְנוּ</span>*, but <span class="he">נָתַ֫נּוּ</span>
        * Not <span class="he">נָתַ֫נְתָּ</span>*, but <span class="he">נָתַ֫תָּ</span>

> Stative verbs describe a state of being, such as "wise", "old", or even "dead"

* The $V_S$ may change in some forms
* There is what is called a "Patach Stative" that prefers $V_S$ of (wait for it...) Patach
    * Since Qal Perfect _already_ prefers a $V_S$ of Patach, there is no visible change
    * Patach Stative has a different $V_S$ in the Imperfect conjugation
    * <span class="he">גָּדַ֫ל</span>, "he is great" is an example - this word maintains the Perfect Strong paradigm all the way through
* Tsere Stative has $V_S$ of Tsere in the P3ms ONLY
    * <span class="he">כָּבֵ֫ד</span> = "he is honored"
    * All other PGN follow the Perfect Strong
* Holem Stative has $V_S$ of Holem in P3ms, P2ms, and P1cp
    * Holem Statives are relatively rare and do not even appear in the Bible as P2fs or any of the plural forms other than P1cp
    * <span class="he">יַכֹ֫ל</span> = "he is able to" or "he can"
    * <span class="he">קָטֹ֫נְתִּי</span> = "I am small"
        * Note the <span class="he">נְ</span> DOES NOT assimilate - Hebrew likes to keep you guessing!

## Qal Perfect Strong: What to Memorize

> You will need to have the Qal Perfect Strong Verb Paradigm memorized "like a robot" before proceeding to Lesson 14

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/13.QP_paradigm.gif")
``` 

13.QP_paradigm.gif

* For Qal Perfect strong verbs:
    * No preformative
    * Perfect sufformative (except 3ms)
    * $Pre =$ <span class="he">קָ</span>
        * Exception:
            * 2mp/2fp have $V_1=\bar A$ displaced by a Sheva as required by propretonic reduction
            * $V_1$ will be reduced if there is a pronominal suffix as required by propretonic reduction - Lesson 19

    * $V_S = A$   
        * Exceptions: 
            * 3fs/3cp have $V_S=A$ displaced by a Sheva as required by finite sufformatives
            * Stative verbs may cause other $V_S$ changes
    

| Sing | QP | Plural | QP

## Worksheet: Stem Comparisons {-}

> You now have enough information to begin the [`Stem Comparison Worksheet`](images/StemComparisonWorksheet.pdf){target="_blank"}!

* You will use this sheet throughout the rest of the course
* In the rows you can see the seven Hebrew Stems
* In the columns are selected 3ms conjugations
* In the gray boxes, use the $Pre$ and $V_S$ formulas to mark the paradigm verb of the given conjugations 
    * For example, in the QP3ms cell, you would mark the vowels for <span class="he">קָטַל</span>
        * we recommend marking the $Pre$ prefixes, preformatives, and vowels (as applicable) in RED and the $V_S$ vowels in BLUE for easy visibility
* In the last column row, you will eventually enter the $V_S$ Formula for each Stem.  For now, enter $A$ to the left of the $\sim$ character

## Lesson 13 Conclusion

* You might find yourself a bit tired after this strenuous hike!
* As we've been saying, just soak in as much as you can, then test yourself with `Anki`
* If any the concepts aren't "clicking" after doing the activities, then come back here and review the lesson points
* If you find you need a more thorough walk-through of how to build a Qal Perfect verb, check out Dr. Beckman's YouTube lecture in `Lesson Extras`
* The better you know the concepts in Lessons 13-16, the easier the rest of the Quest will be!

## Anki {-}

* `Lesson 13 A. Vocab`
* `Lesson 13 B. Grammar` 
* `Lesson 13 C. Workbook` 
    * The verb parsing exercises are taking directly from the Study Verses
    * As we will learn next week, "weak" verbs are a lot more common than "strong" verbs
    * Even though we will formally study weak verbs in Lesson 14, you should be able to use your knowledge of $V_1$ and the Perfect preformatives to determine the parsing solution
        * Of course, we've only studied the Qal Perfect!
        * When you encounter a "weak" verb, such as <span class="he">מָלְאָ֥ה</span>, which is 3א, or <span class="he">יָדָ֔עוּ</span>, which is 3עח (A ח or ע as $R_3$), try to see what changes occur (based on what you already know about Gutturals)
* `Lesson 13 D. Study Verses`

> Unless there is something unique to point out, we will omit the Anki section from the Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Guidebook going forward. You know the drill!  Be sure to do the four Anki levels after each Lesson.
