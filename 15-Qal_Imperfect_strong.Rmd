> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to parse and translate Qal imperfect verbs

In a few lessons, we will learn about the Vav Conjunction.  The Qal imperfect + Vav Conjunction (abbreviated QIwc)^[The nomenclature comes from academia where the Vav is pronounced Waw] is the most frequent verb form in the Hebrew Bible, so understanding the imperfect is essential.  Like the Qal Perfect Strong paradigm, we must have a robotic-like recall of the Qal Imperfect Strong Paradigm.

<span class="he">וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי אוֹר וַיְהִי־אוֹר׃</span>

You might recognize this from Genesis 1:3 - "And God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light."  There are three verbs in this short sentence, and all three are Qal Imperfect (and two are the Qal Imperfect + Vav Conjunction.

*He watches all my paths (Job 33:11)*

There's a story of a small child who was beginning to understand the implications of God's power.  "Do you mean God is watching everything I do?" the child asked with mounting fear.  Her father quickly replied, "God loves you so much, He can't take His eyes off you."

Let that sink in as you study Biblical Hebrew.

* The Imperfect has many potential translations
* If you don't have any context, translate Imperfect as future
* In context, watch to see whether the imperfect verb begins a clause as this is a clue
* When the Imperfect does not begin a clause: future, "I will run", or imperfective, "I am running" or "I was running"
* When the Imperfect begins a clause and does not have a Vav Consecutive prefix, the use is what is called _modal_.  We'll study modal forms in Lesson 18.
* An imperfect verb _with_ the Vav Consuctive changes the verb's aspect to Perfect.  We'll study this in Lesson 17
* When the imperfect is preceded by <span class="he">לֹא</span> or <span class="he">אַל</span> it is a negative command
    * We'll have more to say about this towards the end of the lesson
    * Positive commands take a different form, called the _Imperative_, which we will also study in Lesson 18

Qal Imperfect strong verbs have a diagnostic $V_P$ + $V_1$ ($Pre$) combination

* All QI strong verbs except 1cs begin with Hireq+Silent Shewa
    *  <span class="he">ְ יִ</span> for 3ms, 3mp
    *  <span class="he">ְ נִ</span> for 1cp
    *  <span class="he">ְ תִּ</span> for all others except 1cs
* 1cs begins with Aleph+Seghol+Silent Sheva <span class="he">ְ אֶ</span>
* We can summarize this by saying, "for the QI, $Pre =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span>"
    * <span class="he">יִ</span> represents any of the Imperfect preformatives with a Hireq or <span class="he">אֶ</span>
    * <span class="he">קְ</span> represents any strong letter in $R_1$ with a Silent Sheva

::: {.box .info}
The vowels behave as if they were from the Rule of Sheva (they aren't)

```{r, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/15-rule-of-sheva.png")
``` 
:::

::: {.box .caution}
* Note, when you see $Pre$ in the special font, this is not the same as the form's prefix and it is not the same as the form's preformative.  
* $Pre$ is a combination of prefix, preformatives, initial vowels and Daghesh marks as indicated that are diagnostic of a given stem and conjugation.
*For the QI, $Pre =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span>
:::

* Lastly, for the QI, $V_S = \bar O$
* With this we can begin to build our $V_S$ formula we introduced at the very end of lesson 12
* Qal Formula: $V_S = A \sim \bar O$
    * Perfect = Patach
    * Imperfect = Holem

* Of the singular forms, only 2fs has a sufformative
    * It is <span class="he">י ִ</span>
    * The <span class="he">ְ תִּ</span> preformative with the <span class="he">י ִ</span> sufformative is diagnostic of the QI2fs
* Of the plural forms, only 1cp does NOT have a sufformative
    * 2mp/3mp sufformative - <span class="he">וּ</span>
        * Occasionally, there may be what is called a Paragogic Nun, as in <span class="he">וּן</span>^[ The ן sometimes causes the shuruk to shorten to a Qubbutz. In other words, you may see <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span> or <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּן</span> or <span class="he">יִקְטְלֻן</span>.  All three words are QI3mp]
        * You will be able to tell 2mp from 3mp by the preformative
    * 2fp/3fp sufformative - <span class="he">נָה</span>
        * You'll note that QI2fp and QI3fp are identical.   
        * The context will determine whether the verb is being used in the 3rd person or the 2nd person.  
        * These forms are relatively infrequent.
* There are no "heavy sufformatives" in the Imperfect
    * In fact, the two we studied previously (2mp and 2fp) are the only ones
* The last point is to remember that the Imperfect is a Finite verb, so a Sheva prefers to go before a finite verb sufformative


> Now we're ready to put all this together and learn the Qal Imperfect Strong Paradigm, the same way we built the Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm!

Study the graphic and the steps below carefully.  It may seem confusing at first but, with practice, you'll get it.  You'll note that the steps work from left to right.


```{r, out.width = "900pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/15.Qal_imperfect_Strong.png")
``` 

1. Add Imperfect Preformatives 
2. Add Imperfect Sufformatives
3. A Sheva goes before a finite sufformative
    * Sheva goes under $R_2$ (displacing $V_S/V_2$) when $R_3$ already has a vowel
4. $V_S = \bar O$ unless already reduced by the Sheva of the finite sufformative
5. Accent $V_S$ unless it reduced
6. $V_P = I$ and $V_1 = \ :$, except 1cs ($V_P = E$)
    * Qal Imperfect $Pre =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span> - and we simply need to remember to replace the י with the applicable imperfect preformative

## Worksheet: Qal Imperfect Strong Paradigm {-}

As with Lesson 13, we want you to pause here and do the [Qal Imperfect Strong Paradigm](./images/15_qal_imperfect_strong_paradigm.pdf){target="_blank"}.

> Complete the paradigm until you can do it from memory at least once, then return here and continue in the guidebook.


Doing the worksheet now will maximize your learning time. In other words, the material that follows in this lesson will make more sense to you if you have the paradigm in your short-term memory.

* <span class="he">לֹא</span> + imperfect is for permanent prohibitions

* The Qal Imperfect is a critically important form in the Bible so way to go for getting through this lesson
* As we said in the intro to Lesson 14, weak verbs are much more common than strong verbs; this is true for Imperfect as well as perfect
* The authors of _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_ believe Lesson 16 is the high water mark of the course
* Once you master the material in the next lesson, many students find that the rest of the course fits together nicely
* We mention this now in Lesson 15, because the diligent work you do between now, this very moment, and the moment you start Lesson 16 will set you up for maximum success in the remainder of the course
* Be sure you have mastered the Qal Imperfect paradigm, both in terms of speaking it and writing it
    * We know we've said that speaking and writing are not our focus with this course, but here we are making an exception
    * Listening and repeating Izzy's audio several times, completing the worksheet a few more times, and of course doing all of the Anki work and activities, will serve you very well as we had into lesson 16.

>Keep up the fantastic work! You're doing great!
