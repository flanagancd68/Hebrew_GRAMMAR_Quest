## Our Quest

As we progress through the material in this chapter, our quest is to learn how the weak verbs behave in order to work our way back to the Qal Imperfect Strong Verb indicators.

Recall the two primary diagnostic indicators of the Qal Imperfect Strong:

* $Pre \ =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span>
* $V_S = \bar O$


## 2G 

* Reject Daghesh Forte - not applicable in QI as no forms require Dagesh Forte
* When $V_2$ reduces, it will be a Hateph Vowel instead of Vocal Sheva
* Gutturals prefer Patach
    * When NOT reduced, $V_S = A$ instead of $\bar O$ 

::: {.box .light}
Although $V_S = A$, 2G verbs are easily recognized as Qal Imperfect since the $Pre \ =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span> diagnostic is retained
:::

|  | 2G | Strong | 
| :-  | :- | :-  
| 3ms  |  <span class="he">יִבְחַר</span>  | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>
| 3mp  |  <span class="he">יִבְחֲרוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>



## 3חע

* Silent Sheva at $V_3$ remains
* Prefer $V_S = A$

::: {.box .light}

Although $V_S = A$, 3חע verbs are easily recognized as Qal Imperfect since the $Pre \ =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span> diagnostic is retained  
:::

|  | 3חע | Strong | 
| :-  | :- | :-  
| 3ms  | <span class="he">יִשְׁלַח</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>
| 3mp  |  <span class="he">יִשְׁלְחוּ</span>| <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

## 3א  

* While 3חע prefer $V_S = A$, 3א prefer $V_S = \bar A$ primarily
* Will see $V_S = E$, or sometimes $V_S = \bar E$ in 3/2fp 
* 3א quiesces with Silent Sheva (and sometimes with vocal)

::: {.box .light}
Although $V_S$ can vary, 3א verbs are easily recognized as Qal Imperfect since the $Pre \ =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span> diagnostic is retained  
:::

|  | 3א | Strong 
| :-  | :- | :-  
| 3ms | <span class="he">יִמְצָא</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יִמְצְאוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ<span class="he">

## 3ה 

::: {.box .caution}
3ה verbs lose the final ה root consonant in every form

:::

* _IF_ there is no sufformative, _THEN_ $V_2 \ =$ vowel + HEI:
    * Perfect - QAMETS+HEI: <span class="he">בָּנָה</span> - QP3ms
    * Imperfect - SEGHOL+HEI: <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> - QI3ms
* _IF_ the sufformative starts with a vowel, _THEN_ the sufformative IS $V_2$
    * QI3cp - <span class="he">יִבְנוּ</span>
    * QP3cp - <span class="he">בָּנוּ</span>
* _IF_ the sufformative starts with a consonant, _THEN_ $V_2 \ =$ vowel + י
    * Perfect - HIREQ+YOD- <span class="he">בְּנִיתֶם</span> - QP2mp
    * Imperfect - SEGHOL+YOD - <span class="he">תִּבְנֶ֫ינָה</span> - QI(3/2)fp 
    

::: {.box .light}

Despite the endings, 3ה verbs are easily recognized as Qal Imperfect since the $Pre \ =$ <span class="he">יִקְ</span> diagnostic is retained.

:::


|  | 3ה | Strong | Notes
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| QI3ms | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  | Seghol+Hei
| QI3mp | <span class="he">יִבְנוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span> | Sufformative Replaces
| QI(3/2)fp | <span class="he">תִּבְנֶ֫ינָה</span> | <span class="he">תִּקְטֹ֫לְנָה</span> | Seghol+Yod

## 3ה ending comparison table

The table below shows a comparison of 3ה verbs when there is no sufformative.

| Conj | Hebrew | Vowel
| :- | :- | :-
| P | <span class="he">בָּנָה</span> | Qamets+Hei
| I | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> | Seghol+Hei

::: {.box .light}
3ה ENDINGS

* 3ה Verbs are frequent, so we will want to memorize these rules and endings
* They are consistent throughout all stems; e.g., I3ms 3ה verbs end in (Seghol+Hei) in all seven stems

:::


## 1G

* Remember the Rule of Sheva that prevents two contiguous Vocal Sheva/Hateph Vowels
    * NOT <span class="he">יְקְ</span>, BUT <span class="he">יִקְ</span>
    * Whenever we see the $Pre \ =$ <span class="he">ְ יִ</span> of the Qal Imperfect, think "Rule of Sheva"<small>^[<small>Historically the QI $Pre$ did not come the Rule of Sheva, however pretending that it did makes it easy to recognize QI 1G verbs.</small>]</small>
* The 1G will reject the Vocal Shewa in favor of a Hateph Vowel

::: {.box .light}
To identify QI from a 1G verb:

* Turn <span class="he">יַחֲ</span> or <span class="he">יֶחֱ</span> back to <span class="he">יִקְ</span>
* Turn <span class="he">יֶהֶזְ</span> or <span class="he">יַחַלְ</span> back to <span class="he">יִקְטְ</span>
:::


|  | חזק |  חלף  | Strong 
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-  
| 3ms | <span class="he">יַחֲלֹף</span> | <span class="he">יֶחֱזַק</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יַחַלְפוּ</span> | <span class="he">יֶחֶזְקוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

## 1א "Angry Baker"

* There is a special class of  1א verbs that are irregular ONLY in the QI
* They are given the mnemonic "angry baker":
    * "I said אמר,
    * I want אטה you
    * To eat אכל what
    * I bake אפה, or
    * I _may_ seize אחז you<small>^[<small>"MAY seize" here is intentional. Sometimes אחז is regular and sometimes it is "angry."</small>]</small>, and you
    * will perish אבד."
* $V_P = O$ and the א in $R_1$ is quiescent  (usually $V_S = A$)
    * QI1cs: NOT <span class="he">אֹא</span>, BUT <span class="he">אֹ</span>
* Although only a few verbs undergo this change, these verbs frequently appear in the Bible
    * אמר occurs 2,973 times


|  | Reg. 1א | Angry 1א | Strong 
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יֶאֱסֹף</span> | <span class="he">יֹאמַר</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 1cs | <span class="he">אֶאֱסֹף</span> | <span class="he">אֹמַר</span> | <span class="he">אֶקְטֹל</span>
| 3mp | <span class="he">יַאַסְפוּ</span> | <span class="he">יֹאמְרוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

::: {.box .info}
You saw this already with an earlier `Ruth Pursuit`.  וַתֹּאמֶר is an "angry baker" verb.
:::

## Geminate

* Geminate Lose $R_2$ - Dagesh Forte in remaining twin letter (unless word-final or guttural letter)
    * In alternate forms, the Dagesh appears in $R_1$ and $V_P = I$ (see table below)
* Imperfect Preformatives/Sufformatives remain
* $V_S$ and Accent shift to $V_1$
* There will be a connecting vowel before a sufformative that starts with a consonant
    * QP2fp - <span class="he">סַבּוֹתֶן</span>
    * QI2fp - <span class="he">תְּסֻבֶּ֫ינָה</span>

::: {.box .info}
Recognizing the Imperfect preformatives/sufformatives and Geminate vocabulary knowledge will help you recognize QI for Geminate verbs
:::

|  | Gem | Gem (alt) | Strong 
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יַסֹב</span> | <span class="he">יִסֹּב</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יַסֹ֫בּוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִסֹּּבּוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

## Biconsonantal

* $Pre \ =$ <span class="he">יַ</span>
* $V_S$ and accent move to $R_1$
* The Lexical Vowel REMAINS, though sometimes it is defective
    * <span class="he">יָקוּם</span>
    * <span class="he">יָקֻם</span>

::: {.box .info}
The retention of the Lexical Vowel, $V_P = \bar A$ and the Imperfect preformative/sufformative will indicate QI of a Biconsonantal verb
:::

|  | קוּם | Strong 
| :-  | :- | :-  
| 3ms | <span class="he">יָקוּם</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יָק֫וּמוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

## 1-Yod 

* ALWAYS drops 1-yod $R_1$
    * $V_P = \bar E$ or $V_P = \hat I$ (Hireq+Yod)
    * $V_S = \bar E$ or $V_S = A$
    * See examples

| | To return ישׁב | ToiInherit ירשׁ | Strong
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יֵשֵׁב</span> | <span class="he">יִירַשׁ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יֵשְׁבוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִירְשׁוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

::: {.box .info}
* When $V_P = \hat I$, you can visualize the remnants of the QI Strong $Pre$ as well as the 1st yod
* When $V_P = \bar E$, you will need to recognize the Imperfect pre/sufformatives and your knowledge of vocabulary<small>^[<small>Also, you could imagine one of the dots of the Tsere representing the dropped Yod - turn it into a Yod and you have $\hat I$, which is a more normal-looking QI $Pre$.  If you "see" this and it helps, great!  If you don't, forget about it and don't let it confuse you!</small>]</small>
:::


## הלך 

* הלך is an irregular verb that acts like 1-Yod in the Qal Imperfect
* The ה drops and $V_P = \bar E$
* $V_S = \bar E (A)$
    * The (A) means in the Feminine Plural forms, we will see Patach instead of Tsere
    * This will be common notation in Unit 4

| | ישׁב | To walk הלך | Strong
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יֵשֵׁב</span> | <span class="he">יֵלֵךְ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יֵשְׁבוּ</span> | <span class="he">יֵלְכוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

## <span class="he">יכל</span> takes $V_P = \hat U$

| | ישׁב | To be able יכל | Strong
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יֵשֵׁב</span> | <span class="he">יוּכַל</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יֵשְׁבוּ</span> | <span class="he">יוּכְלוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>


## 1נ Assimilates with Silent Sheva

* If guttural or Resh after the נ, the נ usually remains
* Dagesh Forte in $R_2$ when נ assimilates
    * SQiN eM LeVY + Sheva may drop the Dagesh

::: {.box .info}
To get back to QI Strong paradigm, remove the Dagesh Forte and add <span class="he">נְ</span>
:::

|  | 1נ | Strong 
| :-  | :- | :-  
| 3ms | <span class="he">יִפֹּל</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>
| 3mp | <span class="he">יִפְּלוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

## לקח

* Just as <span class="he">הלך</span> thinks it's 1י, <span class="he">לקח</span> thinks it's 1נ
* Note $R_2 =$ <span class="he">ק</span> is SQiN eM LeVY

| | 1נ | To take לקח | Strong
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יִפֹּל</span> | <span class="he">יִקַּח</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>
| 3mp | <span class="he">יִפְּלוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְחוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

## Doubly Weak

* As with the Qal Perfect, there is nothing overly complex about Imperfect Doubly Weak Verbs
* Simply address the changes caused by each weak letter, then and work your way back to the strong form
* Note <span class="he">עשֹה</span> to do/make, in the table below
    * 1G affects $V_P$ and $V_1$
    * 3ה affects $V_2$
    
| | 3ה | Dbl. Weak | 1G
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> | <span class="he">יַעֲשֶֹה</span> | <span class="he">יַחֲלֹף</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יִבְנוּ</span> | <span class="he">יַעֲשֹוּ</span> | <span class="he">יַחַלְפוּ</span>

## נתן is 1נ and 3נ

* 1n assimilates as usual
* 3n assimilates as usual
* The result is only ONE root letter!  
    * But fortunately, this only occurs in QIfp forms
    
::: {.box .light}
<span class="he">נתן</span> is extremely common, so we must study and understand these changes
:::

| | 1נ | To give נתן | Strong
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יִפֹּל</span> |  <span class="he">יִתֵּן</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>
| 3mp | <span class="he">יִפְּלוּ</span> |  <span class="he">יִתְּנוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>
| 3fp | <span class="he">תִּפֹּ֫לְנָה</span> | <span class="he">תִּתֵּ֫נָּה</span> | <span class="he">תִּקְטְלוּ</span>


## ראה vs. ירא

* ירא is 1-yod and 3-aleph
    * $V_P = \hat I$ like 1י
    * 3א quiesces with Sheva (FP forms)
* ראה is  2-guttural and 3-hei
    * Follows normal 3ה patterns - no $R_3$

|  | ראה | ירא | Strong 
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יִרְאֶה</span> | <span class="he">יִירָא</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span>  
| 3mp | <span class="he">יִירְאוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִרְאוּ</span> | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span>

## Qal Imperfect Weak Summary

This is the densest chapter in _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_ yet also one of the most important.  

Once you get comfortable with this chapter's changes, the rest of the course WILL get easier.

Our goal was to give you enough of an overview to get you started on the Anki exercises. Take your time working through `Anki`, and be sure you keep up with your reviews each day.  What may seem foggy now will begin to make sense soon!  

If, as you do the exercises, things just are not clicking into place, we can recommend [Dr. Beckman's lecture on _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_ Chapter 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqAlZba1liQ&feature=youtu.be){target="_blank}.  Note that it is over two-hours in length, so it is very thorough.

Apart from a few irregular changes, the Qal Imperfect is relatively easy to recognize with the distinctive preformatives.  We just need to remember the changes weak letters cause and work our way back to the strong paradigm.
