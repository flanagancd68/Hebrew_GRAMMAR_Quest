# Vav Consecutive {.wc}

Way back from Lesson 2 of _Hebrew Quest_, there was a vocabulary word that illustrates the Vav Consecutive: **וּכְתַטְתָּם***. The initial ו means "and", so this one word is translated "AND you will write them".  It also has a grammatical purpose of changing the verb's meaning from a past tense to a future tense.  **כָּתַטְתָּ*** means "you (ms) wrote" (perfect), but putting a ו as prefix changed the meaning to "and you will write" (imperfect).  We'll learn more about these changes in this Lesson.

The terminology on this topic is a bit fluid. The term "Waw Consecutive" is significantly more prevalent than "Vav Consecutive", so we will stick with the seminary style phrasing for this chapter.

| Hebrew | Description | Also known as | Shorthand
| :- | :- | :- | :-
**וְקָטַל*** | Qal Perfect + ו | Weqatal | QP +
**וְיִקְטֹל*** | Qal Imperfect + ו | Weyiqtol | QP +

### <span class="he">וַיַּשְׁכִּ֣מוּ בַבֹּ֔קֶר וַיַּֽעֲל֥וּ אֶל־רֹאשׁ־הָהָ֖ר </span> {-}

*In the morning, however, they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country (Numbers 14:40)*

The conjunction ו is a powerful linguistic tool in Scripture.  Later in this Lesson, we will study Genesis 1:1-5 from _Hebrew Quest_.  Verse 2 begins with the conjunction prefixed to a noun, while verses 3-5 each begin with what is called the "Waw-Conjunction", which is to say the Vav is prefixed to a verb.

Like the dawning of a new day, after you complete this lesson, a majority the verb forms that appear in the Hebrew Scriptures will be opened to you.  We hope you are as excited about taking this new step into a larger world as we are excited for you!

## Review of the Conjunction Vav

* Usually spelled **וְ***
    * Spelled **וּ*** before פ, מ, ב, or Sheva
    I* Rule of Sheva can create **וִי***
or the "hateph copy-cat",**וַעֲ***

## Perfect + וְ: Spelling

* Always first letter
* Accent shift to ultima in 2ms and 1cs

| | QP | + ו 
| :- | :- | :- 
3ms | <span class="he">קָטַל</span> | <span class="he">וְקָטַל</span>
1cs | <span class="he">קָטַ֫לְתִּי</span> | <span class="he">וְקָטַלְתִּ֫י</span>
3cp | <span class="he">קָטְלוּ</span> | <span class="he">וְקָטְ֫לוּ</span>

## Perfect + וְ: Translating

* Parsing code: Pwc (Perfect Waw Consecutive)
* Often used for the next event in a future narrative
* Usually translated as IMPERFECT
    * Future: And I will study
    * Modal: And I would/could/should study
    * Imperfective: Amd I am/was/will be studying
* After an imperative, usually translate as another imperative:
    * Go and study!
* Can be translated as the normal perfect (past tense)
    * Parsing code in this case would be the perfect code "+ ו", as in QP3ms + ו
    * The accent MAY be a clue
        * **וְשָׁמַרְתִּ֫י*** = QPwc1cs - and I will guarded
        * **וְשָׁמַ֫רְתִּי*** = QP1cs + ו - and I guarded
    * Context is a better guide
    

## Imperfect + וְ: Spelling

* Always first letter
* Usually spelled וְ
    * On the Perfect, there is no difference between the spelling of the Conjunction and the Waw Consecutive - both are, וְ
    * On the Imperfect, the CONJUNCTION is spelled, וְ
    * The Imperfect Waw CONSECUTIVE is spelled, וַיִּ

| | QI | + ו 
| :- | :- | :- 
3ms | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span> | <span class="he">וְיִקְטֹל</span>
1cs | <span class="he">אֶקְטֹל</span> | <span class="he">וְאֶקְטֹל</span>
3cp | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span> | <span class="he">וְיִקְטְלוּ</span>

## Imperfect with Vav often indicates purpose

* Instead of "and", translate, "so that...may"
    * "Shall I go call a Hebrew nurse SO THAT she MAY nurse the child for you?" (Ex 2:7)
    * "Let's make a tower...SO THAT we MAY make a name for ourselves." (Gen 11:4)
* Regular imperfect translations are possible (same as Pwc)

## Imperfect Waw Consecutive: Spelling (Strong)

* Vav + Patach + Dagesh Forte
    * Similar to the independent preposition with the definite article
* In the 1cs form, the Aleph preformative rejects the Dagesh, resulting in Compensatory Lengthening

| | QI | QIwc
| :- | :- | :- 
3ms | <span class="he">יִקְטֹל</span> | <span class="he">וַיִּקְטֹל</span>
1cs | <span class="he">אֶקְטֹל</span> | <span class="he">וָאֶקְטֹל</span>
3cp | <span class="he">יִקְטְלוּ</span> | <span class="he">וַיִּקְטְלוּ</span>


## Imperfect Waw Consecutive: Spelling (Weak)

* 3ה verbs drop the suffix
* Biconsonantal verbs change
* Some other verbs change stem vowel to Seghol

|3ms | QI | QIwc
| :- | :- | :- 
3ה | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> | <span class="he">וַיִּבֶן</span>
Bicons | <span class="he">יָקוּם</span> | <span class="he">וַיָּקָם</span>
Seghol | <span class="he">יֹאמַר</span> | <span class="he">וַיֹּ֫אמֶר</span>

## Imperfect Waw Consecutive: Translation

### Usually translate Iwc as PAST TENSE {-}

* Often used for the next event in a past-time narrative
* Uses the opposite form from what we might expect:
    * Iwc in a PAST narrative
    * Pwc in a FUTURE narrative
* He did X (the first verb will be P), and then he did Y (next verb is Iwc), and then he did Z (Iwc)
* He will do X (first verb is I), then he will do Y (next verb is Pwc)

## Summary

* Iwc is most common **וַיִּקְטֹל***
* Pwc is next **וְקָטֹל***
* P+ו and I+ו are relatively uncommon
