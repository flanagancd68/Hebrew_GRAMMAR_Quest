> To understand Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to distinguish the Vav Consecutive from the conjunction Vav and translate accurately.

Way back from Lesson 2 of _Hebrew Quest_, there was a vocabulary word that illustrates the Vav Consecutive: <span class="he">וּכְתְַבְתָּם</span>.

The initial ו means "and", so we might want to say that this word simply means "and you wrote them." In Hebrew, the Vav Consecutive also has a grammatical purpose of changing the verb's meaning from Perfect to Imperfect.  This is true even though it is affixed to a Perfect verb, <span class="he">כָּתַבְתָּ</span> means "you (ms) wrote" (perfect), but putting a ו as prefix changes the meaning to "and you will write" (imperfect).  The opposite happens when the Vav Consecutive is affixed to an Imperfect verb: the resulting word is Perfect (past tense). Less frequently, there are times with the Vav is just a Vav and is not acting as a Consecutive.  We'll learn more about these changes in this Lesson.

The terminology on this topic is a bit fluid. The term "Waw Consecutive" is significantly more prevalent than "Vav Consecutive" in academic circles, so we will still encounter the "w" references frequently in Hebrew grammar materials.

*In the morning, however, they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country (Numbers 14:40)*

The conjunction ו is a powerful linguistic tool in Scripture.  Later in this lesson, we will study Genesis 1:1-5 from _Hebrew Quest_.  Verse 2 begins with the conjunction prefixed to a noun, while verses 3-5 begin with the "Vav Consecutive", which is to say the letter Vav is prefixed to a verb.

Like the dawning of a new day, after you complete this lesson, most of the verb forms that appear in the Hebrew Scriptures will be opened to you.  We hope you are as excited about taking this new step into a larger world as we are excited for you!

* More Common: used as Perfect Vav Consecutive
* Parsing code: Pwc (Perfect Waw Consecutive, also called the `Weqatal` from the 3ms form וְקָטַל)
* Often used for the next event in a future narrative
* Usually translated as IMPERFECT
    * Future: And I will study
    * Modal: And I would/could/should study
    * Imperfective: And I am/was/will be studying
* After an imperative, we usually will translate as another imperative:
    * Go _and_ _study_!
* Less Common (in fact relatively infrequently): translated as the regular perfect (past tense)
    * The Parsing code, in this case, would be the perfect code "+ ו", as in QP3ms + ו
    * The accent MAY be a clue for the 2ms and 1cs
        * <span class="he">וְשָׁמַרְתִּ֫י</span> = QPwc1cs - and I will guard
        * <span class="he">וְשָׁמַ֫רְתִּי</span> = QP1cs + ו - and I guarded
    * Context is a better guide
* For a smoother English translation, the "and" may need to be changed or omitted entirely
    * Hebrew: And I will study and I will run and I will guard
    * English: Then I will study, run, and guard

* Often used for the next event in a past-time narrative
    * AND GOD SAID (QIwc3ms)...AND THERE WAS (QIwc3ms)
* In a narrative sequence of verbs, the second (and following) verb uses the opposite form from what we might expect:
    * Iwc in a PAST narrative
        * He did X (the first verb will be P), and then he did Y (the next verb is Iwc), and then he did Z (Iwc)
    * Pwc in a FUTURE narrative
        * He will do X (the first verb is I), then he will do Y (the next verb is Pwc)
* We will explore additional uses in Lesson 23

With this lesson, we move away from the selected verses in Proverbs to lengthier study passages.

::: {.box .map}
YOUR HEBREW QUEST:

1. Read the passage - [Blank copy of Genesis 1:1-5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FIQAtWfWlrWmzX5pKR6esRLzJKFdv5Szx3mb5_zWwLg/copy){target="_blank"}, or you may use your copy from Lesson 6
2. Now re-read the passage critically, highlighting ([lexicon here](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"} and translating (you will need to parse verbs to translate)
3. [Watch Izzy's _Hebrew Quest_ video (video opens in a new tab)](https://holylanguage.com/genesis-1.php){target="_blank"}
    * Though we would encourage viewing the entire segment, since you already reviewed Genesis 1:1 back in Lesson 6, you can start with Genesis 1:2 at the 46:50 mark
4. After the video, assess your translation.  How close was it?
5. How did the Ruach HaKodesh speak to you through the passage?

* If your goal is to simultaneously complete both _Hebrew Quest_ and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, you may wish to complete the associated _Hebrew Quest_ passage memorization in Memrise
* The Genesis passage begins in [Memrise Level 17](https://app.memrise.com/course/5406435/hebrew-quest-lessons-1-to-40/17/garden/learn/?source_element=level_details_session&source_screen=level_details){target="_blank}
    * Note that the Memrise work may contain vocabulary and passages in addition to the study passage (for example, Names of God, Titles of Messiah, Terms of Love/Friendship, and Proverbs)
* Although the majority of time in each _Hebrew Quest_ lesson is spent on the Study Passages, be sure to set aside time to watch the lesson's video in its entirety to meet the _Hebrew Quest_ Graduation requirements (also be sure to complete any videos/Memrise modules for Lessons 1-16 that you have not completed)
