# Qal Imperative {.QM}

Lesson 18 marks the start of the second semester of a traditional first-year Hebrew Course.  In other words, congratulations! You are halfway through the course!

Many students believe the second half of the course is easier than the first half.  This is because the foundational work is behind us; reading the Bible, while not yet fluid, is definitely becoming more enjoyable.

We have covered the two primary uses of the Qal stem: the Perfect and Imperfect (including the Waw-Consecutive).  For the remainder of Unit 3, we will round out our study of Qal Verbs with the Volitional forms (Lesson 18), the Infinitive forms (Lessons 20 and 21), and the Participle forms (Lesson 22).

Keep going!

## First Thought {-}

### <span class="he">וְעַתָּ֣ה יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל שְׁמַ֤ע אֶל־הַֽחֻקִּים֙ וְאֶל־הַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָֽנֹכִ֛י מְלַמֵּ֥ד אֶתְכֶ֖ם לַעֲשׂ֑וֹת</span> {-}

*Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform (Deuteronomy 4:1)*

The _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage for this lesson is the Shema, from Deuteronomy 6. Yeshua quoted it as the "greatest commandment."  The Shema reminds us that we study Hebrew to draw closer to Him and love Him with all that we are.

## Volitional Forms Introduction

* Volitional conjugations express someone's will (their volition)
    * Command or permission
    * Wish or desire
    * Purpose
    * Occasionally, used to indicate a result (even if that result was not intended)
* The most common volitional form is the Imperative (Parsing code: M)
    * "Study!"
    * 2nd person
* The Jussive (J) is the 3rd person volitional form
    * "May he study" or "she should study"
    * 2nd person jussives exist
* The Cohortative (C) is the 1st person volitional form
    * "Let us study"
    * "I shall run!"
    
## Negative Commands use the Jussive or the Imperfect

* Negative commands never use the imperative
* לֹא + imperfect
    * An absolute, permanent, blanket prohibition
    * You shall not murder (Ex 20:13)
* אַל + jussive or cohortative
    * An immediate, circumstance-specific prohibition
    * "Do not listen to your prophets!" (Jer 27:9)
    * In this context, Jeremiah is prohibiting the people from listening to FALSE, misguided prophets, not a blanket prohibition of ANY and ALL prophets
    * 2nd person jussives are used for negative commands


## The Imperative is the Imperfect without the Imperfect Preformative

* Apply Rule of Sheva to 2fs and 2mp

|  | QI | QM | 
| :-  | :- | :-  
| 2ms | <span class="he">תִּקְטֹל</span>  | <span class="he">קְטֹל</span>
| 2fs | <span class="he">תִּקְטְלִי</span>  | <span class="he">קִטְלִי</span>
| 2mp | <span class="he">תִּקְטְלוּ</span>  | <span class="he">קִטְלוּ</span>
| 2fp | <span class="he">תִּקְטֹ֫לְנָה</span>  | <span class="he">קְטֹ֫לְנָה</span>

* Rule of Sheva - 2mp is NOT <span class="he">קְטְלוּ</span>, BUT <span class="he">קִטְלוּ</span>

## Identifying QM

1. Lacks I preformative
2. Retains I sufformative (or no sufformative)
3. $V_1$ IS or WAS reduced
    * Rule of Sheva in 2fs/2mp
4. Imperfect $V_S$

## <span class="he">נָה</span> can follow volitional verbs

* <span class="he">נָה</span> may be independent or joined by maqqef
* Scholars debate what this means or whether it means anything
* "Please" or "now" have been suggested
* May leave it untranslated depending on the context

::: {.box .info}
<span class="he">נָה</span> only follows volitional verbs. This helps with parsing.

## Distinguishing QM2ms, QI3ms, and QP3ms

|  | QI3ms | QM2ms | QP3ms
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| Spell | <span class="he">תִּקְטֹל</span>  | <span class="he">קְטֹל</span>  | <span class="he">קָטַל</span>
| $V_1$ |  $:$  |$ə$  | $\bar A$
| $V_2$ | $\bar O$  |$\bar O$  | $A$

## Paragogic ה 

* Paragogic ה is an extra ה appended to  M2ms<small>^[<small>Scholars debate whether this has any meaning.  "Paragogic" is Greek for "dragged along."</small>]</small>
* It occurs 311 times on M2ps forms
    * <span class="he">קְטֹל</span> - regular QM2ms
    * <span class="he">קָטְלָה</span> (Qamets Hatuf) - QM2ms with paragogic ה OR pronominal suffix (Lesson 19) 
        * Note how $V_S = O$ (Qamets Hatuf)
* We will NEVER see the directional ה on verbs, so we can rule that out
* We will need to determine from the context whether the Qamets+Hei is paragogic or a pronominal suffix

## 3ה Verbs

3rd ה verbs undergo the usual changes we have been studying. Now, we are adding a new (vowel) + ה ending for the Imperative:

* No sufformative = Add ה vowel letter
    * Perfect - <span class="he">ה ָ </span> (Qamets+Hei)
    * Imperfect - <span class="he">ה ֶ </span> (Seghol+Hei)
    * Imperative - <span class="he">ה ֵ </span> (Tsere+Hei)
* If sufformative starts with a vowel, use that vowel for $V_2$
* If sufformative starts with a consonant, add (vowel)+Yod
    * Perfect - <span class="he">י ִ </span> (Hireq+Yod)
    * Imperfect/Imperative - <span class="he">י ֶ </span> (Seghol+Yod)

## 3ה Comparison Table

We can now add the Imperative to our table of 3ה verbs with no sufformative.

| Conj | Hebrew | Vowel
| :- | :- | :-
| P | <span class="he">בָּנָה</span> | Qamets+Hei
| I | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> | Seghol+Hei
| M | <span class="he">בְּנֵה</span> | Tsere+Hei


::: {.box .light}
3ה ENDINGS

* 3ה Verbs are frequent, so we will want to memorize these rules and endings
* They are consistent throughout all stems; e.g., M2ms 3ה verbs end in (Tsere+Hei) in all seven stems

:::


## 1נ and 1י

* 1י drops in the QM
* 1נ _sometimes_ drops in the QM
    * For example, נסע, נתן do; נפל does not
* These have the Imperfect $V_S$, unless it has reduced

::: {.box .light}
Carefully study the verbs in the table below
:::

|  | QI2ms | QM2ms  | QM2mp | 
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-  
| <span class="he">ישׁב</span> | <span class="he">תֵּשֵׁב</span>  | <span class="he">שֵׁב</span>  | <span class="he">שְׁבוּ</span>  
| <span class="he">ירשׁ</span> | <span class="he">תִּירַשׁ</span>  | <span class="he">רַשׁ</span> | <span class="he">רְשׁוּ</span>
| <span class="he">נסע</span> | <span class="he">תִּסַּע</span>  | <span class="he">סַע</span>  | <span class="he">סְאוּ</span>
| <span class="he">נתן</span> | <span class="he">תִּתֵּן</span>  | <span class="he">תֵּן</span>  | <span class="he">תְּנוּ</span>
| <span class="he">נפה</span> | <span class="he">תִּפֹּל</span>  | <span class="he">נְפֹל</span> | <span class="he">נִפְלוּ</span>


## Biconsonantal and Geminate

* These verbs pose little problems
* The imperfect preformative is dropped
* The Imperfect $V_S$ is retained; since this is in the $V_1$ position, the vowel does not reduce

| Verb | QI2ms | QM2ms
| :- | :- | :-
| <span class="he">קוֹם </span> | <span class="he">תָּקוֹם </span> | <span class="he">קוֹם</span>
| <span class="he">שִׁים </span> | <span class="he">תָּשִׁים </span> | <span class="he">שִׁים </span>
| <span class="he">בוֹא </span> | <span class="he">תָּבוֹא </span> | <span class="he">בּוֹא </span>
| <span class="he">סבב</span> | <span class="he">תָּסֹב</span> | <span class="he">סֹב </span>
| <span class="he">תמם</span> | <span class="he">תֵּתַם</span> | <span class="he">תַּם</span>

## Masculine Third Person QP and 2nd Person QM are potential look-alikes

* QP3ms doesn't drop $R_1$ 
* QP3ms has $V_1 = \bar A$ consistently
* Memorizing the 3ה rules for each conjugation will help us distinguish

| Type | QP3ms | QM2ms
| :- | :- | :-
| Strong | <span class="he">קָטַל</span> | <span class="he">קְטֹל</span>
| 1י | <span class="he">יָשַׁב</span> | <span class="he">שֵׁב</span>
| 1נ | <span class="he">נָסע</span> | <span class="he">סַע</span>
| 3ה | <span class="he">בָּנָה</span> | <span class="he">בְּנֵה</span>
| Bicons. | <span class="he">קָם </span> | <span class="he">קוּם</span>


| Type | QP3mp | QM2mp
| :- | :- | :-
| Strong | <span class="he">קָטְלוּ</span> | <span class="he">קִטְלוּ</span>
| 1י | <span class="he">יָשְׁבוּ</span> | <span class="he">שְׁבוּ</span>
| 1נ | <span class="he">נָסְעוּ</span> | <span class="he">סְעוּ</span>
| 3ה | <span class="he">בָּנוּ </span> | <span class="he">בְּנוּ</span>
| Bicons. | <span class="he">קָ֫מ </span> | <span class="he">ק֫וּמוּ </span>

## Cohortative and Jussive Introduction

* These are more nuanced conjugations
* Cohortative (parsing code C)
    * 1st person volitional
    * Often translated as "let us...", or "may I..."
* Jussive (parsing code J)
    * 3rd Person volitional
    * "let him...", "let them...", "may he..."
* Often, the spelling of a Jussive is identical to the Imperfect
    * Word placement in a clause is key to translation; see info box below
* The Cohortative usually (but not always) ends in $\hat A$ (Qamets+Hei)
    * **אֶקְטְלָה*** = QC1cs
* Less frequently, there are 2nd person Jussives
    * Less forceful than a command
    * For example, "would that you..."
    
::: {.box .info}
IDENTIFYING THE COHORTATIVE/JUSSIVE

If an Imperfect verb (without a Vav prefix) is the FIRST WORD in a clause, then see if a volitional translation fits better than an unnuanced Imperfect translation
:::

## Some weak verbs often shorten the Jussive singular


| Type | QI3ms | QJ3ms | Translation
| :- | :- | :- | :-
| 3ה | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> | <span class="he">יִבֶן</span> | Let him build
| Bicons. | <span class="he">יָשִֹים</span> | <span class="he">יָשֵֹׁם</span> | Let him put
| Bicons. | <span class="he">יָשׁוּב</span> | <span class="he">יָשֹׁב</span> | Let him return
