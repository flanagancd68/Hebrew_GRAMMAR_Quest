>Hebrew verbs frequently contain pronominimal suffixes. To understand Biblical Hebrew, we must have an understanding of how suffixes are used with verbs.

Instead of learning something entirely new, Lesson 19 will be one where we take a concept you already know and apply it to a new scenario.

The verbal pronominal suffixes are the same suffixes we learned from Lesson 9.  In fact, verbs ONLY use the "Type 1" suffixes.  

The more challenging aspects can include significant spelling and accent changes.  This can result in words that are identically spelled but have different meanings.  

One of the first vocabulary words in _Hebrew Quest_ was <span class="he">וּכְתְַבְתָּם</span>.  We mentioned in Lesson 17 how this word has the Vav Consecutive (AND you will WRITE them).  It also has a 3mp pronominal suffix (and you will write THEM).

In Lesson 19, we will explore these pronominal suffixes from Lesson 9 and apply them to verbs.

### <span class="he">אֲנִֽי־קְרָאתִ֣יךָ כִֽי־תַעֲנֵ֣נִי אֵ֑ל הַֽט־אָזְנְךָ֥ לִ֝֗י שְׁמַ֣ע אִמְרָתִֽי׃</span> {-}

*I have called upon You, for You will answer me, O God; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech. (Psalms 17:6)*

Imagine walking along a path like the one pictured below on a day Yeshua taught in this same area. What would you be thinking and feeling?  

* Would you be giddy, as if if you got special access to a famous entertainer or dignitary?  Would you try to get His autograph or a "selfie" with Him?
* Would you be skeptical, wondering whether this man named Yeshua you have heard about is really "all that"?  In the back of your mind, would you even be questioning whether He is a fraud?
* Would He be just another voice with a platform like all the people with thousands of followers on YouTube today?
* Or, would you know there is something special about Him? Would you have realized that Yeshua is God, come to bridge the divide between you and the Father?  

Be honest.  

Meditate on that as you work through this lesson, and as you study the "Avinu" in this lesson's _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage.

Although we watched this 10-minute _Hebrew Quest_ video back in Lesson 9, the concepts Izzy discusses will apply to both Lesson 9 and 19. Since it may have been several weeks since you viewed this previously, we encourage you to review the video before starting this lesson.

* We learned in Lesson 9 that Hebrew has a Definite Direct Object marker <span class="he">אֵת</span> that takes pronominal suffixes
    *  For example, <span class="he">אֹתִי</span>, is "me" and <span class="he">אֹתְךָ</span> is "you (ms)"
* Hebrew also attaches pronominal suffixes to verbs
* We already learned that the PGN of the verb indicates the subject: <span class="he">אָכַל </span> = HE ate (QP3ms)
* A pronominal suffix provides the OBJECT of the verb:  <span class="he">אֲכָלוֹ</span> = He ate IT (QP3ms + 3ms)

* This is good news as you will be able to recognize the suffix immediately (provided you remember them from Lesson 9!).
* The 1cp pronominal suffix is <span class="he">נוּ</span>, which, unfortunately, is the same as the P1cp sufformative
* The preceding vowel/Sheva can help in most cases:
    * _IF_ SHEVA, _THEN_ the <span class="he">נוּ</span> is the is P1cp sufformative
        * A Sheva precedes a finite sufformative
    * _IF_ Vowel that is not a Sheva, _THEN_ <span class="he">נוּ</span> is the pronominal suffix

* Accent shifts to sufformative
* $V_1$ reduces
* $V_S$ is LONG in the 3rd person (usually reduces in 3cp)
* 2fs and 1cs are identical
* (QP2fp - $\nexists$^[This is the mathematical symbol for "does not exist"; in our context, it means there are no examples of the QP2fp with a pronominal suffix in Scripture.])
* Review these changes in the comparison table below
    * Note that the right column displays the form of the verb WITHOUT a suffix - these forms are incomplete without a suffix and are not words by themselves

* Uncommonly, you may see a Daghesh Forte or a נ added to the 3ms suffix in the Imperfect as well as the Imperative

Imperative/Perfect Ambiguity when normal Imperative $V_S = A$

* As with the Imperfect, if the original Imperative $V_S = A$, THEN instead of reducing, $A$ _lengthens_ to $\bar A$
* In the imperative, this occurs with Stative, 2G, and 3G verbs
* The result is ambiguity between the Perfect and the Imperative
    * QM2ms+suffix looks like QP3ms+suffix
    * QM2mp+suffix looks like QP3cp+suffix
* The context will determine whether the verb is directed TO someone (2nd person) or is ABOUT someone (3rd)
* These are given the name "nun type suffixes"

As always, we encourage you not to be overly concerned with these infrequent exceptions.  They are just some additional things to be aware of if, as you're reading, things aren't making sense.
