# Qal Infinitive Construct {.Qinfinitive}

Infinitive constructs are verbal nouns.

There is a unique aspect that makes identifying and parsing the ∞<small>^[<small>If you ever have a need to generate the infinity symbol on a desktop computer, ∞, make sure the `Num Lock` is on (and use the numbers on the keypad layout, not the ones on the top row), hold down the `Alt` key and type `236`, then let go of the `Alt` key. On a phone, you can often type `infinity` and the ∞ symbol will appear.</small>]</small> super easy (but you'll have to read on!)

## First Thought {-}

###  <span class="he">וְשָׁ֣מַרְתָּ֔ אֶת־מִצְוֺ֖ת יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ לָלֶ֥כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֖יו וּלְיִרְאָ֥ה אֹתֽוֹ׃</span> {-}

*Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of Adonai your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him. (Deuteronomy 8:6)*

It is easy to follow Adoni's commandments when they align with our desires.  When they do not align, we face a more difficult decision.  Do we follow in HIS ways, or do we continue in OUR ways?

In our _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage for this lesson, we will read the story of when Adonai commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.  This passage is as beautiful as it is troubling.  How could Adonai ask such a thing?  How could Abraham willingly obey so easily?  What is Adonai trying to teach us?  What would I do if God asked a difficult task of me?

Ponder these things as you work through this Lesson and the study passage.

## _Hebrew Quest_ Qal Infinitves Lecture

View this 3-minute overview video from _Hebrew Quest_ on Hebrew Qal Infinitive Verbs. Izzy spends the bulk of the lecture discussing the Qal Infinitive Absolute form, which we will study in Lesson 21.

## Two types of Infinitives

* Infinitive Construct - Parsing Code: ∞
* Infinitive Absolute (Lesson 21) - Parsing Code: A
* The Infinitives do NOT inflect for person, number, or gender
* Parsing is straightforward - Stem + Conjugation
    * Q∞
    * QA (Lesson 21)
* Prefixes
    * The ∞ can also take prepositional prefixes (which we will discuss a little bit later) or pronominal suffix
    * The A NEVER takes a prefix or suffix


## Q∞ Spelling

* For most verbs: <span class="he">קְתֹל</span>
    * 1G reduces as expected: <span class="he">אֱמֹר</span>
    * 3ח/ע can take a furtive patach, which is ignored when parsing: <span class="he">שְׁלֹחַ</span>

::: {.box .info}
"uh-oh" is the sound a Q∞ (or QM2ms) strong verb makes
:::

## 3ה Endings

* As expected, when a 3ה verb has no sufformative, a vowel is added
* For the ∞, this ending is <span class="he">וֹת</span>
    * The <span class="he">וֹת</span> remains when a pronominal suffix is added
    * Note: in this use, <span class="he">וֹת</span> is not the FP ending - it would be incorrect to say "Q∞fp." ∞ verbs are never inflected for person, gender, or number
* Remember, ∞ verbs never inflect, so there will never be a sufformative; in other words, all 3ה ∞ verbs will have the <span class="he">וֹת</span> ending
* We can continue building our 3ה ending table:

| Conj | Hebrew | Vowel
| :- | :- | :-
| P | <span class="he">בָּנָה</span> | Qamets+Hei
| I | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> | Seghol+Hei
| M | <span class="he">בְּנֵה</span> | Tsere+Hei
| ∞ | <span class="he">בְּנוֹת</span> | Holem+Vav Tav

::: {.box .light}
Memorize the 3ה endings as they will make parsing easier
:::

::: {.box .caution}
LOOK-ALIKE WORDS

* <span class="he">ּבָנוֹת</span> is spelled with a Qamets and means "daughters"
* <span class="he">בְּנוֹת</span> is reduced and means "to build, building"
:::

## 1י and 1נ Spelling

* Usually, but not always, drop the 1-yod/nun
* When dropped, add a final <span class="he">ת</span>, and change the vowels so that it looks like a Segholate noun

* <span class="he">הלך</span> as always thinks it's a 1-yod

| Root | Keep | Drop
| :- | :- | :-
| <span class="he">נסע</span> | <span class="he">נְסֹעַ</span> | <span class="he">סַ֫עַת</span>
| <span class="he">נגע</span> | <span class="he">נְגֹת</span> | <span class="he">גַּ֫עַת</span>
| <span class="he">נתן</span> | <span class="he">נְתֹן</span> | <span class="he">תֵּת</span>
| <span class="he">הלך</span> | $\nexists$ | <span class="he">לֶ֫כֶת</span>

::: {.box .light}
<span class="he">נתנ</span> is tricky _and common_

Memorize <span class="he">תֵּת</span> as Q∞ of נתן
:::

## Biconsonantal

* An easy one, as long as you've memorized your vocab!
* The Q∞ of biconsonantal verbs is simply the lexical form
    * <span class="he">שׁוּב</span>
    * <span class="he">מוּת</span>
    * <span class="he">בּוֹא</span>
    * <span class="he">בּוֹשׁ</span>
    * <span class="he">דִּין</span>
    * <span class="he">בִּין</span>

## Q∞ often is identical to QM2ms

* As one is finite and the other is non-finite, the context should be obvious as to whether one person is giving a command to another person
* Some verbs that lose the Imperfect $V_S = O$ in the QM, RETAIN $V_S = O$ in the Q∞
* 3ה verbs have different word-final ה vowels as mentioned previously

## ∞ take Type 1 Pronominal Suffixes

* Q∞ and QM2ms with pronominal suffix are usually the same
* Both shift vowels with $V_1 \ =$ Qamets Hatuf when there is a pronominal suffix
* Nun-type suffixes ONLY occur with imperfects and imperatives


| No suffix | With Suffix
| :- | :-
| <span class="he">קְטֹל</span> | <span class="he">קָטְל</span>


| Suffix PGN | With Suffix
| :- | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">קָטְלוֹ</span>
| 1cs | <span class="he">קָטְלִי</span>
| 3mp | <span class="he">קָטְלָם</span>
| 1cp | <span class="he">קָתְלֵ֫נוּ</span>

::: {.box .caution}
When affixed to an ∞ verb, the suffix can be the SUBJECT as well as the object.
:::

## Most ∞ have a prefixed preposition

* There are 6595 ∞ in the Bible
    * Only 896 do not have a prefixed preposition
    * 68% have <span class="he">ל</span>

::: {.box .info}
Since only ∞ and Participle can have a prefixed preposition, identifying and parsing the ∞ is usually easy!
:::


## Meaning of ∞

* Often used as a verbal noun - "to hear" or "hearing"
    * In English, "to hear", "to speak", or "to be" are examples of "infinitive" verbs.
* ∞ plus prefix <span class="he">ל</span> 
    * Try "to x" or "by x-ing"
    * Sometimes indicates purpose or result: IN ORDER TO SEE the nakedness of the land = <span class="he">לִרְאוֹת</span> 
    * Something imminent: The sun was ABOUT TO SET = <span class="he">לָבוֹא</span>
    * Verbal noun: It is good TO PRAISE Adonai = <span class="he">לְהֹדוֹת</span>
    * Verbal Noun: Obey BY WALKING in His ways = <span class="he">לָלֶכֶת</span>
* ∞ plus prefix <span class="he">ב</span> or <span class="he">כ</span> is often temporal
    * Often included with <span class="he">וַיְהִי</span> or <span class="he">וְהָיָה</span>
    * Past time: WHEN Israel DWELT = <span class="he">וַיְהִי בִּשְׁכֹּן יִשְֹרָאֵל</span>
    * Future time: WHEN YOU CROSS = <span class="he">וְהָיָה בְּעָבְרְכֶם</span>

## Negating the Infinitive

* The negative particles <span class="he">אַל </span> and <span class="he">לֹא </span> are not used to negate the ∞
* <span class="he">בִּלְתִּי </span> and <span class="he">לְבִלְתִּי</span> are used
* There is no difference in meaning between the two words, but <span class="he">לְבִלְתִּי</span>  is more frequent
* Not to do all my commandments (Lev 26:15) = <span class="he">לְבִלְתִּי עֲשׂוֹת אֶת־כָּל־מִצְוֺתַי</span>
