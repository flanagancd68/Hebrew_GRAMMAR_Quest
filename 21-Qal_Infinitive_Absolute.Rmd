The Qal Infinitive Absolute (abbreviated QA) is relatively infrequent, occurring 872 times.  It has a unique function, with no direct equivalent in English.  It generally adds emphasis to, or sometimes replaces another Hebrew verb entirely.  We will study a few of these different uses in this lesson.  We will also look at the functions of two articles,  יֵשׁ and אֵין.

### <span class="he">אָנֹכִ֗י אֵרֵ֤ד עִמְּךָ֙ מִצְרַ֔יְמָה וְאָנֹכִ֖י אַֽעַלְךָ֣ גַם־עָלֹ֑ה</span> {-}

*"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again (Genesis 46:4)*

Our _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage for this Lesson is the Priestly Blessing from Numbers 6, which begins, "the LORD bless you and keep you...". The LORD kept his promises to keep Israel when the nation was in Egypt.  This Lesson's grammar subject is the Infinitive Absolute.  In Hebrew, the Infinitive Absolute is often used to emphasize another verb. When this happens, the verb being emphasized will be repeated, but in the Infinitive Absolute form. 

In, <span class="he">אַעַלְךָ גַם־עָלֹה</span>, the literal translation might be, "I will bring you up again bringing up."
The _meaning_ of the phrase is, "I will SURELY bring you up again," as if to say, "Don't worry! I am definitely bringing up out of Egypt. In fact, there is zero chance I will not bring you up!"  

This is an excellent picture of what the LORD means when He says He will "keep" us!

* The QA has a distinctive $V_2 = \hat O$ (Holem+Vav)
    * <span class="he">קָטוֹל</span> or <span class="he">קָטֹל</span> (defective spelling)
* If the Q∞ was "uh-oh", then the QA is "ah-oh"
    * Most weak verbs follow the "ah-oh" pattern
    * 3ע/ח verbs will take a Furtive Patach under $R_3$ but this affects pronunciation only (not parsing or translation)
    * 3ה verbs can appear in two forms
        * Holem+Hei = <span class="he">עָשׂה </span>
        * Holem+Vav with no Hei = <span class="he">עָשׂוֹ</span>
    * Biconsonantal verbs, including I- and U-class usually take the Holem+Vav/Holem $V_S$
        * <span class="he">קוֹם </span> or <span class="he">שׂוֹם</span>
        * O-class look the same in QA/Q∞/QM2ms = <span class="he">בּוֹא </span>
            * Sometimes QA is defective = <span class="he">בֹּא</span>
    * Geminate verbs retain all three letters with $V_2 = \hat O$ - <span class="he">סָבוֹב</span>
* Parsing (parsing code: A)
    * Never inflects for person, number, or gender
    * Never has a pronominal suffix
    * Never has a prefixed preposition

* Frequently, the absolute serves to emphasize a finite verb from the same root
* The Infinitive Absolute form may appear before or after the finite verb
* The Absolute can emphasize the _CERTAINTY_
    * 2 Kings 1:16: <span class="he">מוֹת תָּמוּת</span> =
    * You will surely die (lit: dying you will die)
    * There is zero chance you will NOT die
    * A mnemonic might be: "there is ABSOLUTE certainty" that the verb's action will occur
* The Absolute can emphasize the _EXTENT_
    * Judges 1:28: <span class="he">וְהוֹרֵישׁ לֹא הוֹרִישׁוֹ</span>
    * He did not completely drive him out (note these verbs are Hiphil stem)
* The Absolute may _substitute_ for another verb conjugation
    * Often, the absolute substitutes for an Imperative verb
        * Deuteronomy 5:12: <span class="he">שָׁמוֹר אֶת־יוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת</span> 
        * Observe Shabbat!
* The Absolute can denote _ongoing action_ that is often contemporaneous with another action
    * 2 Sam 15:30: <span class="he">וְעָלוּ עָלֹה וּבָכֹה</span> 
    * They went up, weeping as they went (lit: they went up, going up and weeping)

* These are particles that assert the existence or non-existence of something or someone
* Mnemonics: 
    * יֵשׁ sounds like "yes" as in "yes there are"
    * אֵין sounds like the English slang word "ain't," as in "ain't nothing or nobody"
* These do not inflect for gender or number 
    * אֵין could mean "there is not" or "there are not"
* When prefixed with <span class="he">לְ</span>, indicates possession or non-possession
    * We saw this way back in the Lesson 3 `Study Verses`
    * Genesis 44:20 - <span class="he">יֶשׁ־לָנוּ אָב זָקֵן</span> = we have an elderly father (lit: there is to us a father old)
* Pronominal suffixes occur on יֵשׁ only 9 times, compared with 104 times on אֵין 
    * 2 Kings 17:34: <span class="he">אֵינָם יְרֵאִים</span> = they do not fear
