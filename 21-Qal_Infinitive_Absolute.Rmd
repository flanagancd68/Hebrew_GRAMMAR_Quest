## First Thought {-}

### <span class="he">אָנֹכִ֗י אֵרֵ֤ד עִמְּךָ֙ מִצְרַ֔יְמָה וְאָנֹכִ֖י אַֽעַלְךָ֣ גַם־עָלֹ֑ה</span> {-}

*"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again (Genesis 46:4)*

Our _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage for this Lesson is the Pristly Blessing from Numbers 6, which begins, "the LORD bless you and keep you...". The LORD kept his promises to keep Israel when the nation was in Egypt.  This Lesson's grammar subject is the Infinitive Absolute.  This has no direct equivalent in English. In Hebrew, it is often used to emphasize another verb. When this happens, the verb being emphasized will be repeated, but in the Infinitive Absolute form. In, **אַעַלְךָ גַם־עָלֹה***, the literal translation might be "I will bring you up again bringing up", but what it means is "I will SURELY bring you up again," as if to say, "Don't worry! I am definitely bringing up out of Egypt. In fact, there is zero chance I will not bring you up!"  

This is a great picture of what the LORD means when He says He will "keep" us!

## QA

* Spelling
    * Has a distinctive $V_2 = \hat O$ (Holem+Vav)
    * **קָטוֹל*** or **קָטֹל*** (defective spelling)
    * If the Q∞ was "uh-oh", then the QA is "ah-oh"
    * Most weak verbs follow the "ah-oh" pattern
        * 3ע/ח verbs will take a Furtive Patach under $R_3$, but this affects pronunciation only (not parsing or translation)
        * 3ה verbs can appear in two forms
            * Holem+Hei = **עָשׂה ***
            * Holem+Vav with no Hei = **עָשׂוֹ***
        * Biconsonantal verbs, including I- and U-class typically take the Holem+Vav/Holem $V_S$
            * **קוֹם *** or **שׂוֹם***
            * O-class look the same in QA/Q∞/QM2ms = **בּוֹא ***
                * Sometimes QA is defective = **בֹּא***
        * Geminate verbs retain all three letters with $V_2 = \hat O$ - **סָבוֹב***
* Parsing (parsing code: A)
    * Never inflects for person, number, or gender
    * Never has a pronominal suffix
    * Never has a prefixed preposition

## 3ה endings

| | Hebrew
| :- | :-
| P | <span class="he">בָּנָה</span>
| I | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span>
| M | <span class="he">בְּנֵה</span>
| ∞ | <span class="he">בְּנוֹת</span>
| A | <span class="he">בָנֹה</span> or <span class="he">בָנוֹ</span>

## Meaning of Infinitive Absolute

* Emphasize a finite verb from the same root - the Infinitive Absolute form may appear before or after the finite verb
    * In terms of certainty
        * 2 Kings 1:16: **מוֹת תָּמוּת*** = you will surely die (lit: dying you will die)
        * A mnemonic might be: "there is ABSOLUTE certainty you will die!"
    * In terms of extent
        * Judges 1:28: **וְהוֹרֵישׁ לֹא הוֹרִישׁוֹ*** = he did not completely drive him out (note these verbs are Hiphil, not Qal, hence no "ah-oh")
* Substitute for another verb conjugation
    * Often imperative - Deuteronomy 5:12: **שָׁמוֹר אֶת־יוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת*** = Observe Shabbat!
* Ongoing action, often contemporaneous with another action
    * 2 Sam 15:30: **וְעָלוּ עָלֹה וּבָכֹה*** = they went up, weeping as they went (lit: they went up, going up and weeping)


## Infinitive Construct vs Infinitive Absolute

| | ∞ | A
| :- | :- | :-
PGN | No PGN | No PGN
Paradigm | **קְטֹל*** | **קָטוֹל***
Sound | uh-oh | ah-oh
1י and 1נ | Drop | Never Drop
3ה | use **וֹת*** | 3ה use **ה ֹ *** or **וֹ***
Bicons | use Lexical $V_S$ | use **וֹ***
Pron. suffix | Yes | Never
Preposition prefix | Usually | Never
Meaning | purpose/result | emphasize certainty
English equivalent | Verbal noun "to do" or "doing" | No direct equivalent

## **יֵשׁ *** and **אֵין *** 

* These are particles that expresses the existence or non-existence of something or someone
    * Mnemonics: 
        * יֵשׁ sounds like "yes" as in "yes there are"
        * אֵין sounds like "ain't" as in "ain't nothing or nobody"
* Do not inflect for gender or number 
    * אֵין could mean "there is not" or "there are not"
* When prefixed with **לְ***, indicates possession or non-possession
    * We saw this way back in the Lesson 3 `Study Verses`
    * Genesis 44:20 - **יֶשׁ־לָנוּ אָב זָקֵן*** = we have an elderly father (lit: there is to us a father old)
* Pronominal suffixes occur on יֵשׁ only 9 times, compared with 104 times on אֵין 
    * 2 Kings 17:34: **אֵינָם יְרֵאִים*** = they do not fear

## Ruth Pursuit {-}   

There are no Qal Infinitive Absolutes in Ruth 1 (if you find one, let us know!), but we do have a few words for you to identify
