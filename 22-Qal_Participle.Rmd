# Qal Participle {.QPt}

## Stem Comparison Table

* Now that we have concluded our discussion on the Qal stem, take a moment to review this table showing the Perfect 3ms, the Imperfect 3ms, and the Participle ms strong verb forms
* Take note of the $Pre$ patterns in red and the $V_S$ in blue
    * When you are able to work your way back to the $Pre$ pattern of the Strong verb means you will correctly identify the stem and conjugation most of the time
* The last column indicates the $V_S$ pattern for perfects on the left, and Imperfects/Imperatives/Infinitives on the right.
* We will update this table as we conclude each additional stem in Unit 4
