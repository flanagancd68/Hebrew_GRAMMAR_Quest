##  First Thought {-}

###  <span class="he">וְיִבְטְח֣וּ בְ֭ךָ יוֹדְעֵ֣י שְׁמֶ֑ךָ כִּ֤י לֹֽא־עָזַ֖בְתָּ דֹרְשֶׁ֣יךָ יְהוָֽה׃ </span> {-}

*And those who know Your name will put their trust in You, For You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You. (Psalms 9:11)*

Our _Hebrew Quest_ study passage for this lesson is Matthew 13 and the parable of the sower. Yeshua clarifies that the "good soil" is someone who hears the word, understands it, and then does something with it.  In contrast, the soil among the thorns is someone who hears the word but doesn't fully trust in Adonai or his promises.  We see one of these promises in Psalms 9:11.

It's become a cliche for Bible teachers to ask, "which of the four soils are you?"  In truth, for most of us, our lives at some point have reflected each of four soils.  So the better question to ask might be:

> "Today, in the next 1440 minutes, how can I make sure that I am the 'good soil', trusting in Adonai, and producing a yield for the Kingdom?"

## Participles are Verbal Adjectives

* Participles are non-finite because they do not have 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person
* Since Participles are adjectives, the DO inflect for gender and number
    * They use the same adjectival endings we learned many lessons ago: MS, FS, MP, FP
    * They are used as adjectives
        * Attributive: I saw running water
            * Match the noun in gender, number, and definiteness
            * Attributive Always After (the noun), Article Always Agrees (with definiteness of noun)
        * Predicative: The water is running
            * Matches the subject in gender and number, but not definiteness
            * Predicate dePrived of the Article, Perhaps Precedes (the noun)
        * Substantival: running is good exercise
            * Has the gender and number of the noun it is replacing

## Qal Active and Passive Participles

* The Qal (and only the Qal) stem has both active and passive particles
* Active: 
    * Parsing code QPtms - Qal Participle masculine singular (no need to say "active")
    * "He who blesses"
* Passive: 
    * Parsing code QPpMS - Qal Passive Participle Masculine Singular (important to denote "passive")
    * "Blessed are you"

## Qal Participle Spelling


* Participles use adjective endings and can appear in Absolute or Construct forms
* Active
    * $V_1 = \bar O$ defective: Holem (more common than plene Holem+Vav)
      * Every form except biconsonantal (which has $V_1 = \bar A$ (Qamets))
    * $V_2$ 
      * Usually $\bar E$ for Masculine singular: <span class="he">קֹטֵל</span>
      * Reduces before adjective endings
        * MP - <span class="he">קֹטְלִים</span>
        * FP - <span class="he">קֹטְלוֹת</span>
    * Two Feminine Singular variations
      * Seghol+Tav - <span class="he">קֹטֶ֫לֶת</span> - MORE COMMON
      * Qamets+Hei - <span class="he">קֹטְלָה</span> - Less common
* Passive: 
    * Every QPp as $V_2 = \hat U$ plene: Shureq (more common than defective Qibbuts)
    * Since $V_2 = \hat U$ it can't reduce; therefore $V_1$ will reduce before adjective endings
    * No FS "T" form

 |Abs | Con
:- | :- | :-
QPtMS | <span class="he">קֹטֵל</span> | <span class="he">קֹטֵל</span>
QPtFS | <span class="he">קֹטֶ֫לֶת</span> or <span class="he">קֹטְלָה</span> | <span class="he">קֹטְלַת</span>
QPtMP | <span class="he">קֹטְלִים</span> | <span class="he">קֹטְלֵי</span>
QPtFp | <span class="he">קֹטְלוֹת</span> | <span class="he">קֹטְלוֹת</span>
| | |
QPpMS | <span class="he">קָטוּל</span> | <span class="he">קְטוּל</span> 
QPpFS | <span class="he">קְטוּלָה</span> | <span class="he">קְטוַּת</span> 
QPpMP | <span class="he">קְטוּלִים</span> | <span class="he">קְטוּלֵי</span> 
QPpFP | <span class="he">קְטוּלוֹת</span> | <span class="he">קְטוּלוֹת</span> 

## Prefixes and Suffixes

* Like any adjective, the conjunction, the definite article, the interrogative particle, and prepositions can be added to Participles
    * Infinitive constructs and participles are the only verb conjugations that can take a prefixed preposition
* Type 1 pronominal suffixes may be added to singular participles
* Type 2 pronominal suffixes may be added to plural participles



## Biconsonantal 

* QPt $V_1 = \bar A$ (Qamets) - always - DOES NOT REDUCE
    * Irregular: **מוּת*** becomes **מֵת*** in Qpt
* QPp $V_1 = \hat U$ or the lexical vowel $\hat I$ (Hireq+Yod)
* Ambiguities
    * **קָם*** - QP3ms, QPtMS
    * **בּוֹא*** - QM2ms, Q∞, QA
    * **קָמָה*** is QPtFS, but **קָ֫מָה*** (note accent) is QP3fs
    
## 3ה 

* The "consonantal" ה drops in all forms of the Qpt
  * In the MS, it is replaced by Seghol+Hei - <span class="he">בֹּנֶה</span>
    * Although the final vowel is shared with the Imperfect, the Pt will never have an imperfect preformative
    * Thus, there is little risk of confusing a 3ה Imperfect with a 3ה Participle
  * In the FS, it is replaced by $\hat A$ (Qamets+Hei) - <span class="he">בֹּנָה</span> (the Tsere+Tav form $\nexists$))
  * There is no vowel letter ה ִin the plural forms
* The Yod reappears as $R_3$ in all forms of the QPp (and the non "T" form of QPtFS)
  * <span class="he">בָּנוּי</span>

### We can now complete our 3ה $V_2$ table {-}


| Conj | Hebrew | Vowel
| :- | :- | :-
| P | <span class="he">בָּנָה</span> | Qamets+Hei
| I | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span> | Seghol+Hei
| M | <span class="he">בְּנֵה</span> | Tsere+Hei
| ∞ | <span class="he">בְּנוֹת</span> | Holem+Vav Tav
| A | <span class="he">בָנֹה</span> or <span class="he">בָנוֹ</span> | Holem+Hei or Holem+Vav
| Pt | <span class="he">בֹּנֶה</span> | Seghol+Hei

MEMORIZE THE 3ה ENDINGS

* As we get ready to journey into Unit 4, this table will be your friend!
* These endings are the same throughout all the derived stems  
:::

## Stem Comparison Table

* Now that we have concluded our discussion on the Qal stem, take a moment to review this table.
* It currently shows the Perfect 3ms, the Imperfect 3ms, and the Participle ms strong verb forms for the Qal stem
  * We will add the additional stems as we work through Unit 4
* Take note of the $Pre$ patterns in red and the $V_S$ in blue
    * When you can work your way back to the $Pre$ pattern of the Strong verb means you will correctly identify the stem and conjugation most of the time
* The last column indicates the $V_S$ pattern for perfects on the left, and Imperfects/Imperatives/Infinitives on the right.
