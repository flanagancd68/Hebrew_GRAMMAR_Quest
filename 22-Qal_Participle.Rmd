##  First Thought {-}

###  <span class="he">וְיִבְטְח֣וּ בְ֭ךָ יוֹדְעֵ֣י שְׁמֶ֑ךָ כִּ֤י לֹֽא־עָזַ֖בְתָּ דֹרְשֶׁ֣יךָ יְהוָֽה׃ </span> {-}

*And those who know Your name will put their trust in You, For You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You. (Psalms 9:11)*

Our _Hebrew Quest_ study passage for this lesson is Matthew 13 and the parable of the sower. Yeshua clarifies that the "good soil" is someone who hears the word, understands it, and then does something with it.  In contrast the soil among the thorns is someone who hears the word but doesn't fully trust in Adonai or his promises, like the promise not to forsake us in Psalms 9:11.

It's become a cliche for teachers to ask, "which of the four soils are you?"  In truth for most of us, our lives at some point have reflected each of four soils.  So the better question to ask might be:

> "Today, in the next 1440 minutes, how can I make sure that I am the 'good soil', trusting in Adonai, and producing a yield for the Kingdom?"

## Participles are Verbal Adjectives

* Participles are non-finite because they do not have 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person
* Since Participles are adjectives, the DO inflect for gender and number
    * They use the same adjectival endings we learned many lessons ago: MS, FS, MP, FP
    * They are used like adjectives
        * attributive: I saw running water
            * Match the noun in gender, number, and definitness
            * Attributive Always After (the noun), Article Always Agrees (with definiteness of noun)
        * predicative: The water is running
            * Matches the subject in gender and number, but not definiteness
            * Predicate dePrived of the Article, Perhaps Precedes (the noun)
        * substantival: running is good exercise
            * Has the gender and number of the noun it is replacing
* The Qal (and only the Qal) stem has both active and passive particles
    * Active: 
        * Parsing code QPtms - Qal Participle masculine singular (no need to say "active")
        * "He who blesses"
        * Every Qpt can be identified by $V_1 = \hat O$  (defective Holem is more common than plene Holem+Vav
            * Exception: biconsonantals have $V_1 = \bar A$ (Qamets)
    * Passive: 
        * Parsing code QPpMS - Qal Passive Participle Masculine Singular (important to denote "passive")
        * "Blessed are you"
        
## Qal Participle

* Participles use adjective endings and can appear in Absolute or Construct forms
* Active
    * $V_1 = \bar O$ defective: Holem (more common than plene Holem+Vav)
    * $V_2$ reduces before adjective endings
    * The QPtFS "T" form is more common
* Passive: 
    * Every QPp as $V_2 = \hat U$ plene: Shureq (more common than defective Qibbuts)
    * Since $V_2 = \hat x$ it can't reduce; therefore $V_1$ will reduce before adjective endings
    * No FS "T form

 |Abs | Con
:- | :- | :-
QPtMS | <span class="he">קֹטֵל</span> | <span class="he">קֹטֵל</span>
QPtFS | <span class="he">קֹטֶ֫לֶת</span> or <span class="he">קֹטְלָה</span> | <span class="he">קֹטְלַת</span>
QPtMP | <span class="he">קֹטְלִים</span> | <span class="he">קֹטְלֵי</span>
QPtFp | <span class="he">קֹטְלוֹת</span> | <span class="he">קֹטְלוֹת</span>
| | |
QPpMS | <span class="he">קָטוּל</span> | <span class="he">קְטוּל</span> 
QPpFS | <span class="he">קְטוּלָה</span> | <span class="he">קְטוַּת</span> 
QPpMP | <span class="he">קְטוּלִים</span> | <span class="he">קְטוּלֵי</span> 
QPpFP | <span class="he">קְטוּלוֹת</span> | <span class="he">קְטוּלוֹת</span> 

## Prefixes and Suffixes

* Like any adjective, the conjunction, the definite article, the interrogative article, and prepositions can be added to Participles
    * Infinitive constructs and participles are the only verb conjugations that can take a prefixed preposition
* Type 1 pronominal suffixes may be added to singular participles
* Type 2 pronominal suffixes may be added to plural participles



## Biconsonantal 

* QPt $V_1 = \bar A$ (Qamets) - always - DOES NOT REDUCE
    * Irregular: **מוּת*** becomes **מֵת*** in Qpt
* QPp $V_1 = \hat U$ or the lexical vowel $\hat I$ (Hireq+Yod)
* Ambiguities
    * **קָם*** - QP3ms, QPtMS
    * **בּוֹא*** - QM2ms, Q∞, QA
    * **קָמָה*** is QPtFS, but **קָ֫מָה*** (note accent) is QP3fs
    
## 3ה were originally 3י

* The Yod reappears as $R_3$ in all forms of the QPp (and the non "T" form of QPtFS)

### We can now complete our 3ה $V_2$ table {-}

* If no sufformative, use:

| Conj. | Hebrew
| :- | :-
| P | <span class="he">בָּנָה</span>
| I and Pp | <span class="he">יִבְנֶה</span>
| M | <span class="he">בְּנֵה</span>
| ∞ | <span class="he">בְּנוֹת</span>
| A | <span class="he">בָנֹה</span> or <span class="he">בָנוֹ</span>
| QPp | <span class="he">בָנוּי</span>

* If sufformatives begins with a vowel, use the sufformative vowel as $V_2$
* If sufformative begins with a consonant
    * Perfect $V_2$ - Hireq+Yod
    * Imperfect $V_2$ - Seghol+Yod
  
## Stem Comparison Table

* Now that we have concluded our discussion on the Qal stem, take a moment to review this table showing the Perfect 3ms, the Imperfect 3ms, and the Participle ms strong verb forms
* Take note of the $Pre$ patterns in red and the $V_S$ in blue
    * When you are able to work your way back to the $Pre$ pattern of the Strong verb means you will correctly identify the stem and conjugation most of the time
* The last column indicates the $V_S$ pattern for perfects on the left, and Imperfects/Imperatives/Infinitives on the right.
* We will update this table as we conclude each additional stem in Unit 4
