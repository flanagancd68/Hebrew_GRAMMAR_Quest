With this lesson, you will begin to put all that information you learned over the past 22 lessons to work in better understanding how the Bible communicates to us.  With this knowledge, we can begin to think critically in our evaluation of differences in translation and the validity of arguments we read in commentaries.  We will cover a lot of Scripture in this lesson.  For this reason, this lesson, including the Anki exercises, will be a bit longer than usual as you store these verses in your heart.  

It was a great move for the authors of _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_ to include this lesson.  Often, Hebrew syntax and meaning is reserved for second year/intermediate Hebrew.  This lesson won't cover all we'll ever need to know but it will get us well on our way to a deeper understanding of Scripture and a deeper relationship with Yeshua.

We're excited for you to begin this lesson.  Let's get to it!

### <span class="he">עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי־גָדוֹל יְהוָה מִכָּל־הָאֱלֹהִים</span> {-}

*Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the Gods (Exodus 18:11)*

Back in Unit 2, we touched on how מִן is quite flexible when it comes to meaning.  A literal reading of this verse might be, "now I know that great is Adonai from all the gods."  מִן changes this to a comparative or even a superlative use. Comparative would be, "Our God is GREATER THAN all the other gods."  A superlative translation might be, "out of all the gods, I know Adonai is THE GREATEST."

This lesson will provide some overarching tips on interpretation and translation based on what we have studied so far.

* A clause has a subject and a predicate.
    * The simplest clause in Scripture is "Yeshua (subject) wept (predicate)"
* An _independent_ clause, such as "Yeshua wept" can be a complete sentence
* A sentence can have more than one clause
    * Now after the death of His servant Moses, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying, “Moses My servant is dead." (Joshua 1:1)
    * There are three clauses in the one sentence
* We've used the terms "word-initial" and "word-final" throughout this course.  Now we will use "clause-initial" to reference the first word in a clause
* <span class="he">ו</span> is frequently clause-initial

Normal Hebrew word order is Verb - Subject - Object.  We can abbreviate this V-S-O (of course, in Hebrew, this goes from right-to-left).

* <span class="he">וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נֹחַ </span>  
    * <figure><figcaption>_And God Remembered Noah (Gen 8:1)_</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/23gen0801.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>

Since we say that V-S-O is the "normal" word order, whenever we encounter a clause that is **NOT** V-S-O, we want to take note as to what is going on.  Below is an example of S-V-O used to emphasize the subject, Adonai.

* <span class="he">*יְהוָה* יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד</span>
     * <figure><figcaption>*Adonai* shall reign forever and ever (Ex 15:18)</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/23Ex1518.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>   
 
Hebrew also can have O-V-S, particularly in poetry.   

::: {.box .light}
English standard word order is S-V-O, so this is the way we would translate regardless of the Hebrew word order.

The Perfect _without_ the <span class="he">ו</span> consecutive is **NOT NORMALLY** the first word in a clause

However, the Perfect _WITH_ the <span class="he">ו</span> consecutive is **ALWAYS** the first word in a clause

* <span class="he">וְאָ֣הַבְתָּ֔ אֵ֖ת יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ</span>
    * _And you will love_ Adonai your God (Deut 6:5) 
* <span class="he">*וְזָכַרְתִּי* אֶת־בְּרִיתִי </span>
    * _And I will remember_ my covenant (Gen 9:15)


As we remember from Lesson 17, the Perfect conjugation with the Vav is usually translated as if it were an Imperfect.

Like the Perfect, the Imperfect _without_ the <span class="he">ו</span> consecutive is **NOT NORMALLY** the first word in a clause.  Below is an "S-V-O" verse we looked at earlier


* <span class="he">יְהוָה *יִמְלֹךְ* לְעֹלָם וָעֶד</span>
    * <figure><figcaption>Adonai _shall reign_ forever and ever (Ex 15:18)</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/23Ex1518.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>  
       
The consecutive Imperfect is the first word in a clause.  This is the most common form in Hebrew narrative.

* <span class="he">*וַיֹּאמֶר* הַנָּחָשׁ אֶל־הָאִשָּׁה</span>
    * <figure><figcaption>The serpent _said_ to the woman (Gen 3:4)</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/23Gen0304.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>  
    
A volitional imperfect (Cohortative and Jussive, each without the Vav consecutive) is usually the first word in the clause.

* <span class="he">*נַעֲשֶׂה* אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ </span>
    * <figure><figcaption>_Let us make_ man in our image (Gen 1:26)</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/23Gen0126.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>

::: {.box .info}
Note without understanding the significance of word placement, these words all follow the Imperfect paradigm.  The key to accurate translation is word order and whether or not there is the <span class="he">ו</span> consecutive prefix.

Hebrew likes to link multiple verbs together. Word order can be a big clue in translating volitional clauses. 

* Multiple Imperatives (M+M) in succession:
    * <span class="he">*עֲלֵה* *וּקְבֹר* אֶת־אָבִיךָ</span>
    * <figure><figcaption>_Go up_ and bury your father (Gen 50:6)</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/23Gen5006.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>
        * This verse would be sequential - go up and (then you can) bury your father
        * The context may indicate a consequential translation - do this **so that** something else will happen
* An Imperative followed by Perfect with Vav Consecutive (M + Pwc)
    * <span class="he">*לֵךְ* *וְאָמַרְתָּ* אֶל־עַבְדִּי</span>
    * <figure><figcaption>_Go and say_ to my servant (2 Sam 7:5)</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/232Sam0705.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>
    * The perfect verb acts as if it were a second imperative ("Go and say", not "go and you will say")
* Imperative followed by an Imperfect or Cohortative (M+I or M+C) to create a purpose or result. "So that..."
    * <span class="he"> *רְדוּ*־שָׁמָּה *וְשִׁבְרוּ*־לָנוּ מִשָּׁם *וְנִחְיֶה* </span>

A conditional phrase is made up of two clauses.  You might want to think of this as an "if-then" statement.  The first gives the "if" condition, and the second states the "then" consequence if the condition is met<small>^[<small>The technical term for the first statement is the _protasis_, and the second statement is called the _apodosis_.</small>]</small> 

* <span class="he">וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלֶיהָ בָּרָק *אִם*־תֵּלְכִי עִמִּי *וְהָלָכְתִּי* *וְאִם*־לֹא תֵלְכִי עִמִּי לֹא אֵלֵךְ</span>

In this course, we have talked about the CONjunctive Vav.  This is a Vav that is prefixed to a verb and serves to link the narrative and move it forward in some fashion.

When a Vav is prefixed to a non-verb, it is called a _DISjunctive_ Vav.  As the name implies, it indicates some kind of break or tangent in the narrative.  There are four primary ways a disjunctive Vav is used, as illustrated by the verses below.

* Parenthetical use: <span class="he">וְהֵם</span>
    * <span class="he">*וְהֵם* לֹא יָדְעוּ כִּי שֹׁמֵעַ יוֹסֵף כִּי הַמֵּלִיץ בֵּינֹתָם</span>
    * <figure><figcaption>_(Now) They_ did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them (Gen 42:23)</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/23Gen4223.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>
    * A parenthetical comment to explain why Joseph's brothers believed they could speak freely

* Circumstantial use: <span class="he">וְאֵין</span>
    * <span class="he">וַיְהִי כְּהַיּוֹם הַזֶּה וַיָּבֹא הַבַּיְתָה לַעֲשׂוֹת מְלַאכְתּוֹ *וְאֵין* אִישׁ מֵאַנְשֵׁי הַבַּיִת שָׁם בַּבָּיִת</span>
    * <figure><figcaption>Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, *and none* of the men of the household was there inside (Gen 39:11)</figcaption> <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="./images/23Gen3911.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></figure>
    * Here we have a break in the narrative, in this case, to provide vital information to set up the circumstances of the attempted seduction and subsequent imprisonment of Joseph

* Contrastive use: <span class="he">וְאֶל</span>
    * <span class="he">וַיִּשַׁע יְהוָה אֶל־הֶבֶל וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ׃  *וְאֶל*־קַיִן וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ לֹא שָׁעָה</span>

    * Often translated "but"
    * This contrasts Adonai's reponse to the two men's offerings

* Introductory use: <span class="he">וְהַנָּחָשׁ</span>
    * <span class="he">*וְהַנָּחָשׁ* הָיָה עָרוּם מִכֹּל חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים</span>

    * A new theme or idea; sometimes an entirely new narrative

## Ruth Pursuit Syntax Study {-}        

::: {.box .map} 

There is no formal quest for this lesson but consider the following points based on the material in Lesson 23<small>^[<small>These concepts are contained in the book, [_A Workbook for Intermediate Hebrew: Grammar, Exegesis, and Commentary on Jonah and Ruth_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825423902/&tag=holylanginst-20), by Robert B. Chisolm</small>]</small> :

* Note the Disjunctive Vav in Ruth 1:2.  Note how the main narrative does not continue but pauses to let us know the names of the people involved.  This is providing supplemental background information. 
* The Conjunctive Vav in Ruth 1:7 serves to begin a more detailed, focused narrative account of Naomi's return
* Note how the Disjunctive Vav in the final clause of 1:14 - Vav + non-verb (subject) + predicate - introduces a CONTRAST of Ruth's attitude of clinging, signaling deep loyalty and attachment to Naomi (see the דבק + בְּ note in Lesson 13 answer key), compared to Orpah's goodbye kiss
* In 1:16, כִּי introduces a subordinate clause that has an explanatory function.  "Ruth tells Naomi to stop urging her to go back because she has determined that she will follow Naomi wherever her mother-in-law goes."<small>^[<small>Chisholm. _A Workbook for Intermediate Hebrew_, page 286.</small>]</small>
* 1:17 has what some scholars refer to as an "oath formula".  <span class="he">כֹּה</span> gives the punishment for breaking the promise, and <span class="he">כִּי</span> gives the condition. The specifics appear to be implied rather than stated. This makes a literal translation awkward.  At the same time, any other translation becomes somewhat speculative and dependent on what the translator believes is the context.  NET renders the first clause as "The LORD will punish me severely."
    * Other oaths of this type appear in 1 Samuel 14:44, 1 Samuel 20:13, 2 Samuel 3:9, 1 Kings 2:23, and 1 Kings 19:2
* In 1:20, כִּי introduces a subordinate clause that has an explanatory function. Naomi is elaborating on why she wants a new name.
* We have noted that most Hebrew clauses begin with a verb, but 1:21 begins with "I".  Naomi is drawing attention to her condition: full when she left, but now returning empty.  Curiously, Ruth evidently counts for nothing.  Naomi's attitude will definitely change by the end of the book!
    * Also, note in 1:21 the Disjunctive Vav clauses, "And Adonai" followed by "And Shaddai."  Chisholm notes that the use may be "semi-poetic": "Adonai has testified about me; Shaddai has afflicted me"<small>^[<small>ibid. p. 133</small>]</small>.
* Finally, the Iwc in 1:22 begins a summarizing, concluding statement bringing the "first act" of the drama to a close.
