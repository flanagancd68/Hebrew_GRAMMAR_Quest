Congratulations!  You now have the hardest work of a first-year Hebrew grammar course behind you.  From here on out, we will be studying the six major derived Hebrew Verb stems Niphal, Piel, Pual, Hiphil, Hophal, and Hitpael.

The reason we spent so much time on the Qal stem is not only because it's the most frequently occurring stem, but everything from this point forward is based on what you learned in Unit III.  This means, for the most part, the lessons that follow will be shorter and much more methodical.

If you remember our introduction to Unit III, we drew the comparison to a math formula.  If we know $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, we do not need to memorize the dimensions of every triangle (assuming that were possible).  Instead, we can take the metaphorical triangle in front of us and use the formula to get what we need.  In Unit III, you learned all the formulas.  Unit IV will merely present you with "triangles" of different sizes.  

Summaries of each of the derived stems will consist of the overall diagnostic features.  It is THESE features that should be memorized, not the numerous paradigms.

> 12 lessons remain in the course (Lesson 36 is a wrap-up); two for each of the six derived stems

* The first (even number) will cover the "Strong" Verb paradigm
    * The meaning of the stem
    * The spelling of the stem
        * $Pre$ sequence - the word-initial Prefix/Preformative and $V_1$ vowel combinations
        * $V_S$ formulas to help you "diagnose" the stem when you encounter it in the Bible
    * Complete forms of each conjugation using the קטל paradigm verb
        * The Perfect and Imperfect forms will have the Audio from Chapter 15 of _Hebrew Quest_
        * The Anki deck will have exercises to help you with paradigm identification
        * Each lesson will have a worksheet for you to practice the paradigm
        * As we have said, __identification of patterns is more important than memorization of paradigms__
* The second (odd number) will address weak verb deviations
    * The "b-side" will cover spelling changes  caused by the behaviors of gutturals and other weak letters, Geminate verbs, Biconsonantal verbs, and other irregular verbs
    * Most of the time, you will already know the concepts
        * For example, in some forms of the Niphal Strong paradigm, $R_1$ takes a Dagesh Forte
        * You already know that if $R_1$ is a guttural or Resh, $R_1$ will reject the Dagesh Forte and often (but not always), there will be Compensatory Lengthening

> There are only a handful of non-Qal verbs in Ruth 1

You will only see the `Ruth Pursuit` activities in the following Lessons:

* Lesson 25 - Niphal
* Lesson 27 - Piel
* Lesson 31 - Hiphil
* Lesson 35 - Hitpael

In Lesson 26, we will start to do a `Ruth Pursuit Analysis`.  

* Here, we will start to use your `Ruth Pursuit Translation Worksheet` and your knowledge of grammar rules to begin to compose a paraphrase
* We will take a few verses at a time
* You will compose your own paraphrase translation and then compare it to published Bible versions of your choice
* This exercise is for your edification
    * You do not have to turn this in and, it will not be graded as a part of this course (as you know, no grades are ever recorded in this course)
    * We would encourage you to share your passage with the Holy Language Institute Tribe for their edification
* Composing a translation of Ruth and/or Jonah is a common assignment in a second year Hebrew course; we believe you will get a lot out of this new activity

> The derived stems tend to be much more consistent with their application of stem vowels

* We will use the code we introduced at the end of Unit III to memorize the stem vowels for non-Qal Strong verbs - our thanks to Dr. Beckman for this innovation in Hebrew learning
* For example, the stem vowel code for Niphal is 

$$V_{S} = A \sim \bar E (A)$$

* $V_{S}$ means the <u>S</u>tem <u>V</u>owel
* Everything to the LEFT of the tilde $\sim$ is the stem vowel in the PERFECT conjugation
* Everything to the RIGHT of the tilde is the stem vowel in the IMPERFECT and related forms, Jussive, Cohortative, Imperative and Infinitive Construct
* The tilde itself is just a separator symbol with no inherent meaning
* Any exceptions are inside `[]` for the perfect `()` for the imperfect
    * The Niphal has no exceptions for the perfect, but other stems change the stem vowel in the 1/2 person - this vowel will be listed inside `[]`
    * Imperfect form exceptions listed inside `()` apply to the Feminine Plural
        * Therefore $(A)$ in the formula means the Stem Vowel in the Imperfect FP, the Jussive FP, and the Imperative FP is Short A - Patach
        * There are no Cohortative (1st person) feminine forms
* What about Infinitive Absolute and Participles?
    * It turns out that for stems besides the Qal the Infinitive Absolute like $\bar E$ (Tsere)
    * Participles, again other than Qal, tend to like the _PERFECT_ $V_S$, _LENGTHENED_ if possible
        * So for the Niphal Participle, since the Perfect $V_S = A$, the Participle $V_S = \bar A$ (Qamets)
