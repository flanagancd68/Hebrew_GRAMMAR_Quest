The Piel stem occurs 6,473 times in the Hebrew Bible. 
P - 2,120
I - 2446
M - 436
∞ - 708
A -84
Pt - 679

Many students find the Piel is one of the easier stems to identify.  It is one of only three Verb stems (along with the Pual and Hitpael) that has a Dagesh Forte in $R_2$. The Piel is easily distinguished from the Pual, which has a steady U-class vowel.  The Piel is also easily distinguished from the Hitpael, which has a unique prefix.

In addition to the Dagesh Forte, the Piel has a $Pre$ combination that (in the strong form) is relatively free from confusion with any other Hebrew Verb Stem.

*With my lips, I have told of All the ordinances of Your mouth (Psalms 119:13)*

With our study of Hebrew, we can get closer to the original intent of God's ordinances.  However, if we are not already keeping His words, worshiping and serving Him, and serving others in our native language, then nothing about learning Hebrew by itself will transform our lives.  

We must practice the disciplines of worship, service, and study (and teaching if that is our calling) so that these traits become hard-wired habits.  If that is already in place then we can use Hebrew to reach new depths in our relationships.

* Reminders:
    * The table gives broad generalization; many verbs do not fit neatly into the table's definitions
    * Use a lexicon/dictionary to check the meanings in different stems
    * Many references will label the 2nd row as "Intensive Action," but this is a controversial topic in the academic community

* In fact, when you see a Dagesh in $R_2$, it's more than likely either a Piel form or a 1-נ verb that has assimilated.  If you see three root letters, it's probably a Piel
    * Two other Stems take a Dagesh in $R_2$ - Pual (Lesson 28) and Hitpael (Lesson 34).  As we will learn in those lessons, both forms are easily distinguished from Piel.
* Gutturals, Resh, SQiN eM LeVY letters reject the Daghesh Forte
    * SQiN eM LeVY will be discussed later in this lesson
    * Gutturals/Resh will be discussed in Lesson 27

The Piel is remarkably consistent.  
While there are distinctive $Pre$ and $V_S$ combinations, it's easiest to remember the stem by the mnemonic "Piēl - Paēl"
:::

* Piēl in PERFECT
    * $V_1 = I$
    * $V_S = \bar E$ in the 3rd person
        * <span class="he">קִטֵּל</span> - DP3ms
    * $V_S = A$ in the 2nd/1st person
        * <span class="he">קִטַּ֫לְתָּ</span> - DP2ms
* Paēl in ALL OTHER CONJUGATIONS
    * $V_1 = A$
    * $V_P = :$ (or Hateph Patach in DI1cs), where applicable
    * $V_S = \bar E$
    * <span class="he">יְקַטֵּל</span> - DI3ms
    * <span class="he">קַטֵּל</span> - DM2ms/D∞/DA
    * <span class="he">מְקַטֵּל</span> - DPtMS

* For completeness, the Piel $V_S$ formula is below
    * This is the first time seeing $\bar E[A] \sim$
    * This means that while the 3rd person takes $\bar E$, the 1st and 2nd perfect forms take $V_S = A$
    * Do not confuse a vowel in brackets to the left of the $\sim$ with a vowel in parenthesis to the RIGHT
        * A vowel in brackets to the left means the 1st and 2nd person forms in the PERFECT take that vowel
        * A vowel in parenthesis to the right means the Feminine plural forms in the NON-PERFECT take that vowel

$$V_{S} = \bar E[A] \sim \bar E$$

* As we have mentioned previously, SQiN eM LeVY is a mnemonic for a group of letters that can reject a Dagesh Forte when the letter has a Sheva
    * S - שׁשּצס
    * Q - ק
    * N - נ
    * M - מ
    * L - ל
    * V - ו
    * Y - י

* As we saw in the paradigm tables, all verbs place a Sheva in $V_2$ in P3fs, P3cp, (I/M)2fs, I3mp, (I/M)2mp, Pt(m/f)p, as well as frequently when there is a pronominal suffix
* The Piel stem places a Sheva in $V_P$, in conjugations that have a preformative
    * The Iwc places a Daghesh in the Imperfect Preformative
    * So the י in DIwc3ms and DIwc3mp may lose the Daghesh

::: {.box .caution}
If you see a word that otherwise looks like a Piel but there is no Daghesh Forte where one is expected, you may have a SQiN eM LeVY consonant with a Sheva.

* Word: <span class="he">גִּדַּלְנוּ </span>
    * The Dagesh in the Gimmel is a Lene (not preceded by a vowel), but the Dagesh in the Dalet is preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva, so this must be a forte.
        * A Forte in what appears to be $R_2$ Should get your attention 
        * The two questions you should start asking when you see a Forte in $R_2$:
            * "Is this Piel?"
            * "Is this an assimilated נ1" - if you clearly see $R_1$ you can rule out this option
    * $Pre =$ גִּדַּ, distinctly Piel Perfect
    * $Sufformative =$ נוּ, Perfect 1cp
    * $Root =$ <span class="he">גדל</span>
    * $V_S = A$ - We might expect Tsere in the Piel, but then we remember that Piel Perfect takes Patach in 1st/2nd person
    * Result: Piel Perfect 1cp, we made great

* Word: <span class="he">אֲדַבֶּר</span>
    * Immediately, note the Daghesh in $R_2$
        * Your mind should immeadetly be asking, "is this Piel?"
        * Potentially, this could be an assimilated 1-nun verb, but we already have what appear to be three-root letters visible
    * Then remember "Piel-Pael" and note this rhymes with Pael.  So without doing much analysis, we're already pretty sure this is a Piel, non-Perfect.
    * $Pre =$ אֲדַבּ, 
        * We expect $V_P = ə$ in the Piel; but, as we know, the Aleph takes the Hateph vowel instead of Sheva
        * The Patach+Dagesh+Tsere combination is consistent with Piel non-Perfect
    * $Sufformative =$ None. With the Aleph preformative, this is I1cs
    * $Root =$ <span class="he">דבר</span>
    * $V_S = \bar E$, consistent with Piel (except DP1/2 person)
    * Result: Piel Imperfect 1cs I will speak

* Word: <span class="he">לַמֵּד</span>
    * The Dagesh Forte in $R_2$ suggests Piel or assimilated 1-Nun
        * Of the verb examples on this page, this is the only one where a 1-nun might be plausible
            * We have the ל, which is a common prefix to an infinitive construct
            * If there was a verb נמד, we might want to probe this further as a possible ∞, but we don't know a verb נמד
            * Even if this were a 1נ verb,, the vowels don't match up
        * We DO know a verb למד though
            * Like in other areas of life, when we have a set of multiple possibilities, the most direct path is often the correct one
        * You also note that the word rhymes with "Pael", suggesting a "working hypothesis" of Piel, non-perfect
    * $Pre =$ לַמּ,
    * $Sufformative =$ none.  No preformative, no sufformative could be QP, but the vowels don't match Qal at all. The vowels do match Piel.
        * This can't be DP because $V_1 \not = I$
        * This can't be DI because all Imperfects have a preformative
        * This can't be DPt because DPt begins with <span class="he">מְ</span>
        * DM2ms, D∞, and DA each work
    * $Root =$ <span class="he">למד</span>
    * $V_S = \bar E$, consistent with Piel (except Piel Perfect 1/2 person)
    * Result: D(M2ms/∞/A) - Teach! or to teach

We are now at the exciting stage where we can begin to stitch together an analysis of Ruth 1.  This will be much the same as you have done with the `Hebrew Quest Study Passages`.  The main difference is you will not have Izzy's video explanation.  In that sense, you will now be wading a little deeper into the Hebrew pool! 

We're going to do this in small chunks over the next several lessons.  

If Ruth 1 is "Act 1" of the drama, we'll start with what is "scene 1": Ruth 1:1-6.

::: {.box .map}
YOUR QUEST

1. Read Ruth 1:1-6 in the Hebrew text and underline any words or forms do you not recognize
    * For the first time, try doing this without any study aids, including your `Ruth Pursuit Translation Worksheet`
    * Then as needed, look up the words you don't recognize
2. Using what you have learned about syntax/phrase constructions and context, compose your own interpretative translation (this time, using your `Ruth worksheet` and whatever other resources you'd like!)
    * You may wish to compose a structural outline of "mini-scenes" identified by conjunctive or disjunctive clauses, quotations, or other constructions
3. Compare your version with translations of your choice.  These may include JPS, KJV, ESV, NASB, NIV, or NLT.^[We do recommend you avoid strict paraphrase versions such as "The Message", as well as the other translations discouraged by Izzy in his ["Bible Reviews" series](https://holylanguage.com/bibles.html)]
4. At what points do you agree and disagree with translation decisions made by these publications? 

This exercise is for you.  Although you will need to complete this activity in order to earn your diploma, you will not have to turn this in, and it will not be graded as a part of this course.  We would encourage you to share your passage with the Holy Language Institute Tribe for their feedback and encouragement.
