## First Thought {-}

### <span class="he">בֹּ֤אוּ שְׁעָרָ֨יו ׀ בְּתוֹדָ֗ה חֲצֵרֹתָ֥יו בִּתְהִלָּ֑ה הֽוֹדוּ־ל֝֗וֹ בָּרֲכ֥וּ שְׁמֽוֹ׃</span> {-}

*Enter His gates with thanksgiving And His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him, bless His name. (Psalms 100:4)*

``` 



## 3-Guttural

::: {.box .light}
* 3-G verbs will change the Stem Vowel
* In the Piel, we can determine the Stem by the $Pre$ and $Suf$, so we can effectively ignore what happens to the $V_S$
:::

* Strong - $V_S = \bar E(A) \sim \bar E$
* 3-ע/ח - $V_S = A \sim A$
* 3-א - $V_S = \bar E \sim \bar E(A)$
* 3-ה - The same as 3-ה in other stems
    * Memorize the 3-ה endings:

```{r, out.width = "500pt", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/25-3-hei_endings.png")
``` 


## 2-Aleph/Resh often cause DP $V_1 = \bar E$ and $V_1 = \bar A$ in all other forms

* 2-G verbs will take Hateph vowel instead of Vocal Sheva
    * By know, you already know this.  Whenever you see a hateph vowel just substitute a Sheva to get back to the Strong paradigm
    * DP3cp - <span class="he">קִטְּלוּ</span> (strong) is <span class="he">נִחֲלוּ</span> (2-G)
* 2-G and 2-ר will reject the Dagesh that is diagnostic of the Piel stem
    * 2-ר/א will almost always have Compensatory Lengthening
        * DP2ms, Not *<span class="he">בִרַּ֫כְתָּ</span>, but <span class="he">יְבֶרַ֫כְתָּ</span> (Hireq lengthens to Tsere)
        * DI3ms, Not *<span class="he">תְּבַרֵךְ</span>, but <span class="he">תְּבָרֵךְ</span>(Patach lengthens to Qamets) 
    * 2-ה/ח/ע usually do NOT have compensatory lengthening in Piel
        * DP3cp - Not *<span class="he">נִחֲּמוּ</span>, but <span class="he">נִחֲמוּ</span>

::: {.box .info}
Most verbs either exhibit compensatory lengthening or they do not; however, some verbs may exhibit either pattern.
:::

## 1-Nun

* As we know, what makes a 1-nun verb weak is the tendency to assimilate when the nun has a sheva
* $V_1$ is NEVER a sheva<small>^[<small>To "connect the dots", if $V_2$ MUST be a Dagesh Forte, than $V_1$ MUST be a vowel that is not a sheva.</small>]</small> so 1-Nuns are actually strong in the Piel (meaning there are no spelling changes compared to the Piel Strong Verb Paradigms)
* The challenge is that the $Pre$ of a 1-nun Piel Perfect verb is identical to the $Pre$ of a Niphal Perfect verb
* To demonstrate, consider <span class="he">נִגַּ֫שְׁתָּ</span>, which is either DP2ms or NP2ms:
    * We do not know whether the <span class="he">נִ</span> is the nun of the Niphal prefix or the 1-nun of the Root in the Piel
    * We also do not know whether the dagesh in <span class="he">גּ</span> represents the assimilated 1-Nun in the Niphal or the Doubled $R_2$ in Piel
    * The $V_S = A$ in both the perfect 1st and 2nd person
        * and $V_S$ is reduced in the P3fs and P3cp in both stems
    * Context may help if the voice is clearly active or passive, but remember many Niphal meanings are active
    * You may need to consult a reference for these
    
::: {.box .info}
The good news is that the P3ms $V_S$ are not the same in Piel ($\bar E$, as in <span class="he">נִצֵּל</span>) and Niphal ($A$, as in <span class="he">נִַצָּל</span>), so the far more common P3ms forms can be differentiated.
:::

## Biconsonantal: the Polel minor stem

* Biconsonantal verbs lack $R_2$ so there will be no Dagesh
* What happens is that $R_3$ is doubled (as if it were a geminate) and there is a Holem Vav (sometimes written as a defective Holem) at $V_1$
* Example <span class="he">רוּם</span>
    * DP3ms <span class="he">רוֹמֵם</span> - this is also the same as DM2ms and D∞
    * DP2ms <span class="he">רוֹמַ֫מְתָּ</span>

::: {.box .info}
* Biconsonantal Piel is sometimes referred to by the mnemonic, pôlēl
* Take note that pôlēl is also the form for the QPt 
:::

## Geminate

* Gemininate verbs are sometimes strong
    * <span class="he">הִלֵּל</span> or <span class="he">יְהַלֵּל</span>
* Sometimes they are like pôlēl
    * <span class="he">פּוֹרֵר</span> or <span class="he">יְפוֹלֵל</span>

## Other weak $R_1$ forms

Generally, these are not a problem because we are not trying to reduce $R_1$ or put a Dagesh Forte in $R_1$

## What to Memorize for Piel Weak

* 3-ה verb endings in all stems
* 2-G/2-ר verbs lack the Dagesh in $R_2$ - may have compensatory lengthening
* 1-נ verbs in DP = NP (except for 3ms)
* The mnemonic, pôlēl, to remind you of Biconsonantal or Gemininate

::: {.box .info}
For most weak verbs, the strong diagnostics of the Piel are retained: 

1. Dagesh Forte in $R_2$
2. "Piel-Pael" ($V_1 = I$ in the Perfect, and $V_1 = A$ everywhere else)
3. $V_P = \ :$ where applicable (Imperfect and Participle)
:::

## Piel Weak Parsing Examples

* Word: <span class="he">כַּלּוּ </span>
    * $Pre =$ כַּלּ 
        * The Dagesh has us thinking Piel and the Patach fits with a non-Perfect Piel beginning.  
        * There is no imperfect preformative, which indicates D(M/∞/A)
    * $Suf =$ וּ -
        * Could be P3cp, but we already ruled Perfect out above. 
        * This is also 3mp Imperfect or 2mp Imperative
        * Based only on $Pre$ and $Suf$, we have a strong suspicion this is likely DM2mp
    * $Root =$ <span class="he">כלה</span> - 
        * We might think כלו, but there is no such word, and we're already pretty sure the shurek is the $Suf$
        * When a $Suf$ begins with a vowel, the ה of a 3-ה verb drops.  
        * From our vocabulary, we know כלה means "to finish"
    * $V_S$ has been erased as is common with 3-ה verbs
    * Result: DI2mp - Finish!

* Word: <span class="he">כִּלּוּ</span>
    * Use the same detective work as כַּלּוֹ above, only the Hireq+Daghesh now takes us down a Piel Perfect trail
    * Result: DP3cp

* Word: <span class="he">שֵׁרְתוּ </span>
    * $Pre$: $V_1 = \bar E$ might give you pause, but when you look at the next letter, you see a Resh, which rejects the Dagesh forte.
        * The first question to ask is, "I wonder whether this was Hireq+Dagesh originally? Given that there is no other prefix or preformative, this could be Piel Perfect."
    * $Suf=$ Shurek P3cp/I3mp/M2mp
        * The lack of preformative rules out this being an I3mp
        * There are no imperatives that have $V_1 = I / \bar E$
    * $Root =$ <span class="he">שׁרת</span>
    * $V_S = :$, The original $V_S$ (whatever it was) has been reduced by the Sheva of the finite sufformative.  As it is, we have enough to conclude that this is Piel Perfect.
    * Result: DP3cp - they served
