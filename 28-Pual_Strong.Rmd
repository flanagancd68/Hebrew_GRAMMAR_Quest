### <span class="he">בְּחֶ֣סֶד וֶ֭אֱמֶת יְכֻפַּ֣ר עָוֺ֑ן וּבְיִרְאַ֥ת יְ֝הוָ֗ה ס֣וּר מֵרָֽע׃</span> {-}

*By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for, And by the fear of Adonai one keeps away from evil. (Proverbs 16:6)*

## Pual Verb Stem Table and Meaning

| |Active Voice| Passive Voice | Reflexive Voice
|:- |:- |:- |:-
Simple Action	| Qal | Niphal | Niphal
Cause a State	| Piel | _PUAL_ | Hitpael
Cause an Action	| Hiphil | Hophal

The Pual is the Passive of the Piel, or sometimes, the passive of the Qal

* <span class="he">שׁלם</span>
    * D: To repay
    * Dp: To be repaid
* <span class="he">הלל</span>
    * Q: To praise
    * Dp: to be praised
* <span class="he">ילד</span>
    * Q: To give birth
    * D: To cause to give birth (be a midwife)
    * Dp: To be born



## Parsing Clues - _Pre_: $V_1 = U$ - ALWAYS for strong verbs

* The Pual is very consistent making it easily recognizable
    * $V_1 = U$ - ALWAYS for strong verbs
* Perfect: <span class="he">קֻטּ</span>
* Imperfect: <span class="he">יְקֻטּּ</span>
    * $V_P = \ :$ (I1cs/I1cp never occurs)
* Parcitiple: <span class="he">ּמְקֻט</span>

::: {.box .light}
The Qibbuts under the first root consonant distinguishes the Pual Form
:::

## Parsing Clues - $V_S = A$ and Dagesh Forte in $R_2$

* $V_S = A$ - ALWAYS for strong verbs (unless reduced by the Sheva of the Perfect Sufformative)
    * I.e. $V_S = A \sim A$
    * Pt lengthens as expected: $V_S = \bar A$
* The Pual retains the other diagnostics of the Piel:
    * Daghesh Forte in $R_2$




## Pual: what to memorize

* Parsing code: Dp
    * 'D' because $R_2$ is doubled
    * 'p' because passive
* $V_P = \ :$
* $V_1 = U$
* $V_S = A$
* Qibbuts ($R_1$)+Daghesh+Patach is diagnostic of Pual
* Like Piel, beware when $R_2$ is guttural, Resh, or SQiN eM LeVY

## Perfect  

Qibbuts in $V_1$ always

### Participle Prefixes in the Derived Stems {-}

Again we present this table for review:

:- | :-: 
Niphal | נִ |
Piel | מְ
PUAL | <span class="he">מְ</span>
Hiphil | ַמ
Hophal (u-class) | מֻ

## Pual Parsing Examples

* Qibbuts ($R_1$)+Daghesh+Patach is diagnostic of Pual

* Word: <span class="he">גִּדְּלוּ</span>
    * Result: DP3cp

* Word: <span class="he"> גֻּדְּלוּ</span>
    * Result: DpP3cp

## Ruth Pursuit Analysis {-}

It's time for the next segment of translating Ruth.  This time, we'll start with "Scene 2": Ruth 1:7-10.

::: {.box .map}
YOUR QUEST

1. Read Ruth 1:7-10 in the Hebrew text and underline any words or forms do you not recognize
    * For the first time, try doing this without any study aids
    * Then as needed, look up the words you don't recognize
2. Using what you have learned about syntax/phrase constructions and context, provide your own interpretative translation 
    * You may wish to compose a structural outline of "mini-scenes" identified by conjunctive or disjunctive clauses, quotations, or other constructions
3. Compare your version with translations such as JPS, KJV, ESV, NASB, NIV, or NLT.  
    * At what points do you agree and disagree with translation decisions made by these publications?

This exercise is for you.  You do not have to turn this in and it will not be graded as a part of this course.  We would encourage you to share your passage with the Holy Language Institute Tribe for their edification.
