# The Pual Stem - Strong Verbs {.Dp-s}

The Pual stem has a diagnostic Qibbuts as $V_1$, making this stem super easy to recognize. 

The Pual occurs 423 times in the Hebrew Bible: 

* Perfect 146
* Imperfect 85 
* Participle: 190
* Never in the Imperative and only once each in Infinitives.

There are no Pual verbs in Ruth chapter 1 so lesson 29 will not have a `Ruth Pursuit` activity.

*By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for, And by the fear of Adonai one keeps away from evil. (Proverbs 16:6)*

## Pual Verb Stem Table and Meaning

| |Active Voice| Passive Voice | Reflexive Voice
|:- |:- |:- |:-
Simple Action	| Qal | Niphal | Niphal
Cause a State	| Piel | _PUAL_ | Hitpael
Cause an Action	| Hiphil | Hophal

The Pual is the Passive of the Piel, or sometimes, the passive of the Qal

* <span class="he">שׁלם</span>
    * D: To repay
    * Dp: To be repaid
* <span class="he">הלל</span>
    * Q: To praise
    * Dp: to be praised
* <span class="he">ילד</span>
    * Q: To give birth
    * D: To cause to give birth (be a midwife)
    * Dp: To be born



## Pual Strong Spelling

* The Pual is very consistent making it easily recognizable
    * $V_1 = U$ - ALWAYS for strong verbs
    
::: {.box .light}
The Qibbuts under the first root consonant distinguishes the Pual Form
:::

* Other characteristics of the Pual:
    * $V_S = A$ - ALWAYS for strong verbs (unless reduced by the Sheva of the Perfect Sufformative)
        * I.e. $V_S = A \sim A$
        * Pt lengthens as expected: $V_S = \bar A$
* The Pual retains the other diagnostics of the Piel:
    * Daghesh Forte in $R_2$
    * $V_P = \ :$ (I1cs/I1cp never occurs)
* The Pual never occurs in DpM, and occurs only once each in Dp∞ and DpA

## Pual Strong $Pre$

* Perfect: <span class="he">קֻטּ</span>
* Imperfect: <span class="he">יְקֻטּּ</span>
* Parcitiple: <span class="he">ּמְקֻט</span>

## Pual: what to memorize

* Parsing code: Dp
    * 'D' because $R_2$ is doubled
    * 'p' because passive
* $V_P = \ :$
* $V_1 = U$
* $V_S = A$
* Qibbuts ($R_1$)+Daghesh+Patach is diagnostic of Pual
* Like Piel, beware when $R_2$ is guttural, Resh, or SQiN eM LeVY

## Ruth Pursuit Analysis {-}

It's time for the next segment of translating Ruth.  This time, we'll start with "Scene 2": Ruth 1:7-10.

::: {.box .map}
YOUR QUEST

1. Read Ruth 1:7-10 in the Hebrew text and underline any words or forms do you not recognize
    * For the first time, try doing this without any study aids
    * Then as needed, look up the words you don't recognize
2. Using what you have learned about syntax/phrase constructions and context, provide your own interpretative translation 
    * You may wish to compose a structural outline of "mini-scenes" identified by conjunctive or disjunctive clauses, quotations, or other constructions
3. Compare your version with translations such as JPS, KJV, ESV, NASB, NIV, or NLT.  
    * At what points do you agree and disagree with translation decisions made by these publications? 

:::

This exercise is for you.  You do not have to turn this in and it will not be graded as a part of this course.  We would encourage you to share your passage with the Holy Language Institute Tribe for their edification.
