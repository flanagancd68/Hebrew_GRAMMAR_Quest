# The Pual Stem - Weak Verbs {.Dp-w}

The distinctive $V_1 = U$ is maintained in nearly all Pual weak forms.  Regardless of other spelling changes, only the Pual has $V_1 = U$.

It is only when $R_2$ rejects the Dagesh Forte AND has Compensatory Lengthening that there is a potential ambiguity.

### <span class="he">גִּבּ֣וֹר בָּ֭אָרֶץ יִהְיֶ֣ה זַרְע֑וֹ דּ֭וֹר יְשָׁרִ֣ים יְבֹרָֽךְ׃</span> {-}

*His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed. (Psalms 112:2)*

As we are approaching the conclusion of the Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest course, a good question to start asking yourself is "what next?" Or, as Yeshua might ask, what are you going to do with this "light" you have been given?  How can you enrich the lives of your family, friends and other people in your circle of influence?  How can your descendants (whomever that might be in your situation) be blessed by your greater knowledge of Hebrew?

## The Pual diagnostic $V_1 = U$ is maintained in almost all weak verbs

* $V_1 = U$ is unique to the Pual stem
* Regardless of other changes that may occur, you will be able to identify the Pual stem in every case, with one exception
* You will still need to know the general weak verb concepts, particularly 3-ה behavior, to make sure you get to the correct Pual conjugation



## 2-Gutturals Reject Dagesh Forte

* When there is NO compensatory lengthening, $V_1 = U$, so we can easily identify Pual
* When there IS Compensatory Lengthening, $V_1 = \bar O$ (Holem)
    * DpP3ms - NOT *<span class="he">בֻּרַּךְ</span>, but <span class="he">בֹּרַךְ</span>
* Ambiguity arises because Qal Participle is also $V_1 = \bar O$, but only the QPtFS and DpP3FS of a 2-G verb are identical.
* Because the Qal stem is much more frequent than the Pual, a correct 1st guess whenever $V_1 = \bar O$ is Qal Participle.  If you notice that $R_2$ is a guttural, you may need to do some more detective work


## Biconsonantal: the Polal minor stem

In every respect except for $V_S = A$, this is identical to the Polel stem for the Piel discussed in Lesson 27.  Polel $V_S = \bar E$
