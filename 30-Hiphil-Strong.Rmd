# The Hiphil Stem - Strong Verbs {.H-s}

With the Hiphil stem, we move into the bottom row of our verb table.  There are approximately 10,000 occurrences of the Hiphil stem in the Bible. The Hiphil stem has the nuance of causing an action, entering into a state, or declaring a state.  Activities for this lesson include identifying Hiphil verbs in Ruth chapter one and, for those doing the _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage track, reading verse by verse through Exodus 19.

## First Thought {-}

### <span class="he">לְכוּ־נָ֛א וְנִוָּֽכְחָ֖ה יֹאמַ֣ר יְהוָ֑ה אִם־יִֽהְי֨וּ חֲטָאֵיכֶ֤ם כַּשָּׁנִים֙ כַּשֶּׁ֣לֶג יַלְבִּ֔ינוּ אִם־יַאְדִּ֥ימוּ כַתּוֹלָ֖ע כַּצֶּ֥מֶר יִהְיֽוּ׃</span> {-}

*"Come now, and let us reason together," Says Adonai, "Though your sins are as scarlet, They will be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They will be like wool. (Isaiah 1:18)*

This is a famous memory verse for traditional Jews and Christians/Believers in Messiah alike.  How beautiful to be able to read and hear in the original Hebrew!  Meditate on it!

<span class="he">יַאְדִּ֥ימוּ</span> is Hiphil Imperfect 3ms

## Meaning of the Hiphil

| |Active Voice| Passive Voice | Reflexive Voice
|:- |:- |:- |:-
Simple Action	| Qal | Niphal | (Niphal)
Cause a State	| Piel | Pual | Hitpael
Cause an Action	| __HIPHIL__ | Hophal

Meanings:

* Cause an action
    * <span class="he">יצא</span>
        * Q - to go out
        * H - to cause something to go out, i.e., to bring out
    * Sometimes passive of Qal - <span class="he">אכל</span>
        * Q - to eat
        * H - to cause to eat, i.e., to feed 
* Enter into or declare the state expressed by Qal
    * <span class="he">זקן</span>
        * Q - to be old
        * H - to grow old
    * <span class="he">רשׁע</span>
        * Q - to be guilty/wicked
        * H - to declare guilty
* Simple action, like the Qal

Parsing Code: H (`H`iphil)

## Hiphil Strong Word Initial Combinations - Think "HIphil-HAphil"

* Preformatives
    * Hiphil verbs have preformative ה
    * Imperfects and Participles have the usual preformatives
* $V_P$
    * Remember "Hiphil-Haphil" (like "Piel-Pael")
    * $V_P = I$ in the PERFECT ("Hiphil")
    * $V_P = A$ EVERYWHERE ELSE ("Haphil")
* $V_1 = :$ 
* $Pre$ combinations are:
    * <span class="he">הִקְ</span> - HP
    * <span class="he">יַקְ</span> - HI, and so forth for the other Imperfect forms
    * <span class="he">הַקְ</span> - HM/H∞/HA
    * <span class="he">מַקְ</span> - Pt

::: {.box .light}
* In most cases, the "H<u>i</u>phil-H<u>a</u>phil" mnemonic is sufficient to identify the Hiphil stem
* Exceptions are when $R_1$ is a weak consonant - we will study these scenarios in Lesson 31
:::

## Hiphil $V_S = Î[A] \sim Î(Ē)$

* $V_S(HPt) = \hat I$ 
    * The Participle is usually the Perfect $V_S$ lengthened. In this case, Hireq+Yod is already long, so there is no change from the Perfect
* $V_S(HA) = \bar E$ as expected.

::: {.box .caution}
Note when $V_S = \hat I$, it may be written defectively as Hireq.  It never reduces because it is an unchangeable long vowel, even when it is written as Hireq.
:::

### Exception to $V_S$ pattern {-}

* HM2ms: $V_S = \bar E$
* Hiwc---: $V_S$ is often $\bar E$ instead of $\hat I$ (Hireq+Yod) when there is no pronominal suffix
    * <span class="he">הַקְטֵל</span>
    * <span class="he">וַיַּקְטֵל</span>


## Don’t confuse  <span class="he">ְ הִ</span> with Niphal Preformative  <span class="he">ָּּ הִ</span>

* Hiphil  - <span class="he">הִקְטִיל</span>
    * No Daghesh Forte in $R_1$
* Niphal - <span class="he">הִקָּטֵל</span>
    * Daghesh Forte in $R_1$
    * $V_1$ = Qamets

## Don't confuse Hiphil Imperfect  <span class="he">ְ יַ</span> with Qal Imperfect  <span class="he">ְ יִ</span>

* Remember "Hiphil" = Perfect; "Haphil" everywhere else
* Imperfect $V_P$ of Hireq is NOT Hiphil
* Ambiguity arises with 1G verbs because of the Rule of Sheva ("Hateph copy-cat")
* As we've discussed, in 1G situations, we can't necessarily rely on the stem's $Pre$ sequence to determine the stem
    * $V_P$ and $V_1$ will be Patach and Hateph Patach in both Hiphil and Qal
    * The Hiphil $V_S$ will be Hireq+Yod
        * HI3ms - <span class="he">יַעֲמִיד</span>
        * QI3ms <span class="he">יַעֲמֹד</span>
* 3ה lose their stem vowel, so 1G+3ה are truly ambiguous
    * (Q/H)I3ms - <span class="he">יַעֲלֶה</span>
    * Context will determine whether he "went up" (Qal) or whether he "brought (something) up" (Hiphil)

## Hiphil Perfect Strong Paradigm

As with the other stems, we list these paradigms to aid in your recognition of these forms.  It is not necessary to memorize these like you had to do with the Qal paradigms.

| Sing | Paradigm | Plural | Paradigm
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">הִקְטִיל</span>  | 3cp | <span class="he">הִקְטִ֫ילוּ</span>

## Hiphil Infinitives Strong


| Type | Paradigm 
| :-  | :- 
| ∞ | <span class="he">הַקְטִיל</span>  
| A | <span class="he">הַקְטֵל</span>

* $V_S$ will distinguish the two Infinitive forms.  HA has a Tsere.
* Note that HM2ms and HA are identical (the context will distinguish)

## Participle Strong

| Sing | Paradigm | Plural | Paradigm
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| ms | <span class="he">מַקְטִיל</span> | mp | <span class="he">מַקְטִילִים</span>
| fs | <span class="he">מַקְטֶ֫לֶת</span> or <span class="he">מַקְטִילָה</span> | fp | <span class="he">מַקְטִילוֹת</span>


* The מ prefix, which characterizes the Participle in the Piel, Pual, Hiphil, and Hophal stems
* $V_S$ = Hireq+Yod throughout (except for one of the FS forms)

### Participle Prefixes in the Derived Stems {-}

Stem | Prefix 
:- | :-: 
Niphal | נִ |
Piel | מְ
Pual | מְ
HIPHIL | <span class="he">ַמ</span>
Hophal (u-class) | מֻ
Hophal (o-class) | ָמ
Hithpael | תִמְ


## Strong Summary

* In most cases, the "H<u>i</u>phil-H<u>a</u>phil" mnemonic for $V_P$ is sufficient to identify the Hiphil stem - $V_P = I$ (Hireq) in the PERFECT, and $V_P= A$ (Pathach) in ALL OTHER CONJUGATIONS
* The exceptions come when $R_1$ is a weak letter (discussed in Lesson 31)
* Hiphil Beginning Combination:
    * <span class="he">ְ הִ</span> - HP
    * <span class="he">ְ יַ</span> - (etc.) HI
    * <span class="he">ְ הַ</span> - HM/H∞/HA
    * <span class="he">ְ מַ</span> - HPt
* $V_S = Î[A] \sim Î(Ē)$
    * It's essential to memorize the $V_S$ formula for each derived stem for those times when we can't rely on the beginning combination

## Hiphil Strong Paradigm Worksheet {-}

Our focus is on recognition, not repetition.  As we stated, in most cases, the "H<u>i</u>phil-H<u>a</u>phil" mnemonic for $V_P$ is sufficient to identify the Hiphil stem.

After you have reviewed the Anki material for this lesson, test yourself by completing the [Hiphil Paradigm Worksheet](./images/30_hiphil_strong_paradigms.pdf){target="_blank"} using the $Pre$ and $V_S$ patterns you have learned.  Repeat until you can complete a column without referring to the answers.

## Ruth Pursuit Analysis {-}

It's time for the next segment of translating Ruth.  We'll continue with "Scene 2": Ruth 1:11-14.

::: {.box .map}
YOUR QUEST

1. Read Ruth 1:11-14 in the Hebrew text and underline any words or forms do you not recognize
    * As needed, look up any words you don't recognize
2. Using what you have learned about syntax/phrase constructions and context, provide your own interpretative translation 
    * You may wish to compose a structural outline of "mini-scenes" identified by conjunctive or disjunctive clauses, quotations, or other constructions
3. Compare your version with one or more published translations such as JPS, KJV, ESV, NASB, NIV, or NLT.  
    * On which points do you agree and disagree with translation decisions made by these publications?

## OPTIONAL _Hebrew Quest_ Study Passage: Exodus 19 {-}


::: {.box .map}
YOUR HEBREW QUEST

1. Read the passage - [Blank copy of Exodus 19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OGYrVxUGGPbwi8ioGi1bnt_vwA4YCNE2XZ2l3GQ8rQM/copy){target="_blank"}
2. Now re-read the passage critically, highlighting ([lexicon here](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"} and translating (you will need to parse verbs to translate)
3. Now, using your marked-up copy of the passage, [watch Izzy's _Hebrew Quest_ video (video opens in a new tab)](https://holylanguage.com/lesson-33.php){target="_blank"}
4. After the video, assess your translation.  How close was it?
    * You may wish to check your parsing [here](https://scholarsgateway.com/search/WLC-ESV/Exocus/19){target="_blank"}
    * Check the "verbs" box to highlight all of the verbs in the passage, then hover over each verb for parsing information
5. How did the Ruach HaKodesh speak to you through the passage?
