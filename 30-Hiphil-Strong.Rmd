# The Hiphil Stem - Strong Verbs {.H-s}

With the Hiphil stem, we move into the bottom row of our verb table.  There are approximately 10,000 occurrences of the Hiphil stem in the Bible. The Hiphil stem has the nuance of causing an action, entering into a state, or declaring a state.  Activities for this lesson include identifying Hiphil verbs in Ruth chapter one and reading verse by verse through Exodus 19.

## First Thought {-}

### <span class="he">לְכוּ־נָ֛א וְנִוָּֽכְחָ֖ה יֹאמַ֣ר יְהוָ֑ה אִם־יִֽהְי֨וּ חֲטָאֵיכֶ֤ם כַּשָּׁנִים֙ כַּשֶּׁ֣לֶג יַלְבִּ֔ינוּ אִם־יַאְדִּ֥ימוּ כַתּוֹלָ֖ע כַּצֶּ֥מֶר יִהְיֽוּ׃</span> {-}

*"Come now, and let us reason together," Says Adonai, "Though your sins are as scarlet, They will be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They will be like wool. (Isaiah 1:18)*

This is a famous memory verse for Jews and Christians/Believers in Messiah alike.  How beautiful to be able to read and hear in the original Hebrew!  Meditate on it!

**יַאְדִּ֥ימוּ*** is Hiphil Imperfect 3ms

## Meaning of the Hiphil

| |Active Voice| Passive Voice | Reflexive Voice
|:- |:- |:- |:-
Simple Action	| Qal | Niphal | (Niphal)
Intensive	| Piel | Pual | Hitpael
Cause an Action	| __HIPHIL__ | Hophal

Meanings:

* Causing an action
    * <span class="he">יצא</span>
        * Q - to go out
        * H - to cause something to go out, i.e. to bring out
    * Sometimes passive of Qal - <span class="he">אכל</span>
        * Q - to eat
        * H - to cause to eat, i.e. to feed 
* To enter into or declare the state expressed by Qal
    * <span class="he">זקן</span>
        * Q - to be old
        * H - to grow old
    * <span class="he">רשׁע</span>
        * Q - to be guilty/wicked
        * H - to declare guilty
* Can also be simple action, like the Qal

Parsing Code: H (`H`iphil)

## Hiphil Strong Word Initial Combinations - Think "HIphil-HAphil"

* Preformatives
    * Hiphil verbs have preformative ה
    * Imperfects and Participles have the usual preformatives
* $V_P$
    * Remember "Hiphil-Haphil" (like "Piel-Pael")
    * $V_P = I$ in the PERFECT ("Hiphil")
    * $V_P = A$ EVERYWHERE ELSE ("Haphil")
* $V_1 = :$ 
* $WI_{H...}$ are therefore (ק represents any non-weak letter):
    * **הִקְ***$WI_{HP}$
    * **יַקְ*** - $WI_{HI3m}$, and so forth for the other Imperfect forms
    * **מַקְ*** - $WI_{HM/H∞/HA}$
    * **מַקְ*** - $WI_{HPt}$

::: {.box .light}
* In most cases, the "H<u>i</u>phil-H<u>a</u>phil" mnemonic for $V_P$ is sufficient to identify the Hiphil stem
* Exceptions are when $R_1$ is a weak consonant - we will study these scenarios in Lesson 31
:::

## Hiphil $V_S = Î[A] \sim Î(Ē)$

* We remember that on the LEFT is the perfect 3rd, with 2nd and 1st person in the brackets
* On the RIGHT is Imperfect, Imperative and Infinitive Construct, with the FP (as applicable) in the brackets
* Memorizing
* $V_S(HPt) = \hat I$ 
    * The Participle is usually the Perfect $V_S$ lengthened. In this case, Hireq+Yod is already long so no change.
* $V_S(HA) = \bar E$   as expected.

::: {.box .info}
Note when $V_S = \hat I$, it may be written defectively as Hireq.  It never reduces because it is an unchangable long vowel, even when it is written as Hireq.
:::

### Exception to $V_S$ pattern {-}

* $V_S(HM2ms) = \bar E$
* #V_S(HIwc) is often Ē instead of Î (Hireq+Yod) when there is no pronominal suffix
* **הַקְטֵל***
* **וַיַּקְטֵל***


## Don’t confuse **ְ הִ*** with Niphal Preformative **ָּּ הִ***

* Hiphil  - **הִקְטִיל***
    * No Daghesh Forte in $R_1$
* Niphal - **הִקָּטֵל***
    * Daghesh Forte in $R_1$
    * $V_1$ = Qamets

## Don't confususe Hiphil Imperfect **ְ יַ*** with Qal Imperfect **ְ יִ***

* Remember "Hiphil" = Perfect; "Haphil" everywhere else
* Imperfect $V_P$ of Hireq is NOT Hiphil
* Ambiguity arises with 1G verbs because of the Rule of Sheva ("Hateph copy-cat")
* As we've discussed, in 1G situations, we can't necessarily rely on the Beginning Combination to determine the stem
    * $V_P$ and $V_1$ will be Patach and Hateph Patach in both Hiphil and Qal
    * The Hiphil $V_S$ will be Hireq+Yod
        * HI3ms - **יַעֲמִיד***
        * QI3ms **יַעֲמֹד***
* 3ה lose their stem vowel so 1G+3ה are truly ambiguous
    * (Q/H)I3ms - **יַעֲלֶה***
    * Our trusted friend, context, will determine whether he "went up" (Qal), or whether he "brought (something) up" (Hiphil)


## Hiphil Perfect Strong Paradigm

As with the other stems, we list these paradigms to aid in your recognition of these forms.  It is not necessary to memorize these like you had to do with the Qal paradigms.

| Sing | Paradigm | Plural | Paradigm

## Hiphil Infinitives Strong


| Type | Paradigm 
| :-  | :- 
| ∞ | **הַקְטִיל***  
| A | **הַקְטֵל***

$V_S$ will distinguish the two Infinitive forms.  HA has a Tsere.
* Note that HM2ms and HA are identical (contest will distinguish)

## Participle Strong

| Sing | Paradigm | Plural | Paradigm
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| ms | **מַקְטִיל*** | mp | **מַקְטִילִים***
| fs | **מַקְטֶ֫לֶת*** or **מַקְטִילָה*** | fp | **מַקְטִילוֹת***


* The מ prefix, which characterizes the Participle in the Piel, Pual, Hiphil, and Hophal stems
* $V_S$ = Hireq+Yod throughout (except for one of the FS forms)

### Participle Prefixes in the Derived Stems {-}

Stem | Prefix 
:- | :-: 
Niphal | נִ |
Piel | מְ
Pual | מְ
Hiphil | ַמ
Hophal (u-class) | מֻ
Hophal (o-class) | ָמ
Hithpael | תִמְ


## Strong Summary

* In most cases, the "H<u>i</u>phil-H<u>a</u>phil" mnemonic for $V_P$ is sufficient to identify the Hiphil stem - $V_P = I$ (Hireq) in the PERFECT, and $V_P= A$ (Pathach) in ALL OTHER CONJUGATIONS
    * The exceptions come when $R_1$ is a weak letter (discussed in Lesson 31)
* Hiphil Beginning Combination:
    * **ְ הִ*** - HP
    * **ְ יַ*** - (etc) HI
    * **ְ הַ*** - HM/H∞/HA
    * **ְ מַ*** - HPt
* $V_S = Î[A] \sim Î(Ē)$
    * It's important to memorize the $V_S$ formula for each derived stem for those times when we can't rely on the beginning combination
    

## OPTIONAL: Hiphil Parsing Worksheet {-}

Our focus is on recognition, not repetition.  As we stated, in most cases, the "H<u>i</u>phil-H<u>a</u>phil" mnemonic for $V_P$ is sufficient to identify the Hiphil stem.
