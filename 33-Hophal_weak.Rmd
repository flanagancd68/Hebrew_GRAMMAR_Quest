# The Hophal Stem - Weak Verbs {.Hp-w}

Hophal weak verb forms are about five-times as frequent as strong verbs.  As with all the forms, we start with the strong verb diagnostics, which make it easier to understand the spelling changes that occur with weak verbs.  By now, you should be well-acquainted with the concepts discussed in this lesson.

*Desolation is left in the city And the gate is battered to ruins. (Isaiah 24:12)*

As people of God, we are sometimes faced with situations where we are tempted to ask, "How could He let this happen?" The people of Isaiah's time who witness the destruction of Jerusalem surely had similar questions. Most of the time, we can not provide a satisfactory answer. The only true choice is to relinquish any notion that we can control the situation and, like Job, trust in Him no matter what the outcome.

## 1G and 3ה Verbs prefer Qamets Hatuf as $V_P$

* $V_1$ will generally be Hateph Qamets Hatuf
* $V_S$ follows the strong paradigm





## 1נ assimilates as expected

* Since $V_1$ is a Sheva, 1נ assimilates just as it does with QI and NP
* $R_2$ will take a Daghesh Forte, if allowed
* We saw this in the `Ruth Pursuit` of Lesson 32
    * <span class="he">הֻגֵּ֨ד הֻגַּ֜ד לִ֗י</span> - "it has thoroughly been declared to me"
        * The verb root is נגד - to tell
        * The Daghesh Forte in the Gimmel represents the assimilated 1נ



## Geminate/Biconsonant prefer Shureq as $V_P$

* The medial letter of the biconsonantal verb is dropped
* Only one geminate consonant is preserved - where possible, a Daghesh Forte will appear in the remaining consonant
* The Holem+Vav as connecting vowel in some forms of the Perfect is another indicator of the geminate verb
