# The Hithpael Stem - Strong Verbs {.HT-s}


> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to identify the Hitpael verbs.

This is one of the shortest and easiest chapters in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.

If you've made it this far, you've earned it!


##  First Thought {-}

###  <span class="he"> וַיַּסֵּ֧ב חִזְקִיָּ֛הוּ פָּנָ֖יו אֶל־הַקִּ֑יר וַיִּתְפַּלֵּ֖ל אֶל־יְהוָֽה׃ </span> {-}

*Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Adonai (Isaiah 38:2)*

Today in Jerusalem, the Western Wall is considered the holiest spot in Judaism.  It is said to be the closest spot one can get to the Holy of Holies.  While this wall was built in the time of King Herod (well after Hezekiah's time), modern Jews and God-fearing gentiles consider it an honor to be able to follow in the tradition of Hezekiah and pray at the wall. 

While we may be physicially removed from Jerusalem and the Western Wall, like Daniel, we can turn towards Jerusalem and bring our petitions to HaShem just as Hezekiah did centuries ago.  

Why don't you stop what you're doing and pray towards Jerusalem right now?

## Meaning of the Hitpael

| |Active Voice| Passive Voice | Reflexive Voice
|:- |:- |:- |:-
Simple Action	| Qal | Niphal | (Niphal)
Intensive	| Piel | Pual | __HITPAEL__
Cause an Action	|Hiphil | Hophal

Meanings:

* Reflexive of the Piel - <span class="he">קדשׁ</span>
    * Q - to be holy
    * D - to be sanctified
    * tD - to sanctify oneself
        * Because this is the most common use, the parsing code is tD - t because a Hitpael preformative always contains ת, and D because, like the Piel, $R_2$ takes a Doubling Daghesh Forte (if possible)
* Reciprocal - <span class="he">ראה</span>
    * Q - to see
    * tD - to look at one another
* Iterative - <span class="he">הלך</span>
    * Q - to walk
    * tD - to walk back and forth, or, to walk (as a way of life)
* Simple active - <span class="he">פלל</span>
    * tD - to pray

## Hitpael Strong Beginning Combinations - Think "_IT"

The Hitpael is probably the easiest stem to identify:

* All conjugations have a distinctive preformative:
    * <span class="he">הִתְקַטֶּל</span> - tDP3ms, tDM2ms, tD∞, or tDA
    * <span class="he">יִתְקַטֶּל</span> - tDI3ms, and so forth for the remaining imperfect stems. 
        * tDI1cs preformative is <span class="he">אֶתְ</span>
    * <span class="he">מִתְקַטֶּל</span> - tDPtms
    * The preformative always has <span class="he"> תְ ִ </span> (except for I1cs)
        * So, if a verb begins with "hIT", "yIT", "mIT", etc, (and $R_1$ is not ת or ט) it's probably Hitpael
        
Also:

* $R_2$ takes Daghesh Forte
* $V_1$ is Patach


## Hitpael $V_S$ = Ē[A] ~ Ē
    * tDP2ms and tDP1cs have $V_S$ = ַ , otherwise it's very consistent

> The Preformative alone is sufficient to identify the Hitpael stem


## Hitpael Perfect Strong

* The standard Perfect sufformatives
* $V_S =$ Patach
* "Signature" tD Prefix: <span class="he">הִתְ</span>

| Sing | Paradigm | Plural | Paradigm
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">הִתְקַטֵּל</span>  | 3cp | <span class="he"> הִתְקַטְּלוּ</span
| 3fs | <span class="he">הִתְקַטְּלָה</span> | 
| 2ms | <span class="he">הִתְקַטַּ֫לְתָּ</span> | 2ms | <span class="he">הִתְקַטַּלְתֶּם</span>
| 2fs | <span class="he">הִתְקַטַּלְתְּ</span> | 2fs | <span class="he">הִתְקַטַּלְתֶּן</span>
| 1cs | <span class="he">הִתְקַטַּ֫לְתִּי</span> | 1cs | <span class="he">הִתְקַטַּ֫לְנוּ</span>

* The standard Imperfect preformatives and sufformatives
* $V_S =$ Patach
* "Signature" tD Prefix: <span class="he">יִתְ</span> (or the applicable Imperfect preformative)

| Sing | Paradigm | Plural | Paradigm
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 3ms | <span class="he">יִתְקַטֵּל</span>  | 3mp | <span class="he"> יִתְקַטְּלוּ</span>

* Note the standard Imperfect preformatives followed by a תְ

## Hitpael Imperative Strong

| Sing | Paradigm | Plural | Paradigm
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| 2ms | <span class="he">הִתְקַטֵּל</span> | 2mp | <span class="he">הִתְקַטְּלוּ</span>
| 2fs | <span class="he">הִתְקַטְּלִי</span> | 2fp | <span class="he">הִתְקַטֵּ֫לְנָה</span>

## Hitpael Infinitives Strong


| Type | Paradigm 
| :-  | :- 
| ∞ | <span class="he">הִתְקַטֵּל</span>  
| A | <span class="he">הִתְקַטֵּל</span>

Although these forms are identical to tDP3ms and tDM2ms, the infinitive forms are infrequent.  The tDA only appears three times in the Hebrew Bible.

## Hitpael Participle Strong

| Sing | Paradigm | Plural | Paradigm
| :-  | :- | :-  | :-
| ms | <span class="he">מִתְקַטֵּל</span> | ms | <span class="he">מִתְקַטְּלִים</span>
| fs | <span class="he">מִתְקַטֶּ֫לֶת</span> | fs | <span class="he">מִתְקַטְּלוֹת</span>

Note the <span class="he">מִתְ </span> prefix in every form, with the characteristic מ of the Participle.
