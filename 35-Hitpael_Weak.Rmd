###  <span class="he">וְנָמַ֤סּוּ הֶֽהָרִים֙ תַּחְתָּ֔יו וְהָעֲמָקִ֖ים יִתְבַּקָּ֑עוּ כַּדּוֹנַג֙ מִפְּנֵ֣י הָאֵ֔שׁ כְּמַ֖יִם מֻגָּרִ֥ים בְּמוֹרָֽד׃ </span> {-}

*The mountains will melt under Him, and the valleys will be split, like wax before the fire (Micah 1:4)*

Our prayer at Holy Language Institute is that you have drawn closer to HaShem through Hebrew, His Holy Language.  We are extremely proud of you and excited that you have completed the course.  With that said, we know that, unless checked by the Spirit, we have an all-too-human tendency to boast in our success.  Let us give glory to Him who alone has the power to call down fire from heaven!

The Hebrew Quest Study Passage for this Lesson is Elijah's story on Mount Carmel in 1 Kings 18. HaShem did precisely that. May we always be reminded that we do all things through Yeshua, who gives us strength.

## $R_2$ can lose Daghesh Forte

* By now, you are very familiar with this concept
* The Hitpael verb MAY lose if  $R_2$ is SQiN eM LeVY consonant with a Sheva
* The Hitpael verb WILL lose if $R_2$ is Guttural or Resh
    * With ע, ה,  and ח there is usually no compensatory lengthening
    * With א and ר $V_1$ will lengthen from Patach to Qamets
        * <span>הִתְבָּרֵךְ</span> tDP3ms of ברך, "he blessed himself"


## Transposition of ת and $R_1$ when $R_1$ is sibilant

* The sibilants are the same letters as the "S" SQiN eM LeVY letters
* The ancients found it easier to pronounce <span>הִשְׁתַּמֵּר</span>* instead of <span class="he">הִתְשַׁמֵּר</span>
    * English has this too: we find it more "comfterble" to pronounce "comfortable" as "comfterble" - we transpose the "r" and "t"
    * Hebrew transposes the "ת" of the Hitpael preformative with the s-sound of $R_1$
* This can be an initial challenge since the <span class="he">ְ הִ</span> looks like Hiphil
    * If you think the root is שׁתם, then you have a stray ר that doesn't fit anywhere
    * Four-letter roots do exist but are exceptionally rare in the Hebrew bible - there is no root = שׁתמר
* The vowels of the Hitpael strong are the same
* Examples:
    * <span class="he">הִסְתַּתֵּר</span> - he hid himself
    * <span class="he">הִשְׂתַּכֵּר</span> - he earned wages for (hired) himself<small>^[<small>BBH mentions that there are three times n the Bible when $R_1$ = <span class="he">צ</span>, not only will the <span class="he">ת</span> switch places, it will change to <span class="he">ט</span>.</small>]</small>


## Preformative תְ assimilates when $R_1$ is ז ד ט ת,

* If $R_1$ is ז ד ט ת (i.e., the "dental" letters) the ת of the Hithpael preformative will assimilate into $R_1$ and remain as a Daghesh Forte
* This can present a potential ambiguity with Niphal; however, note $V_1$ is _QAMETS_ in Niphal compared to _PATACH_ in Hitpael, and $R_2$ will have a Daghesh Forte in Hitpael:
    * <span class="he">הִדַּבֵּר</span> - tDP3ms
    * <span class="he">הִדָּבֵר</span> -NM2ms 



## Hitpolel is tD of some Biconsonantal and Geminate Verbs

* $R_3$ is doubled
* $V_1$ is <span class="he">וֹ</span>
* This is an irregular form, but these words maintain diagnostic Hitpael preformative       
    * <span class="he">הִתְרוּמֵם</span> - Hitpolel (P3ms/M2ms/∞/A), רוּם
    * <span class="he">יִתְרוֹמֵם</span> - Hitpolel I3ms, רוּם
* Same meaning as a normal Hitpael


## <span class="he">חָוָה </span> - Hishtapel Stem

*  <span class="he">חָוָה </span> gets its own stem: Hishtapel
*  <span class="he">חָוָה </span> occurs 173 times in the Bible, only in Hishtapel
*  <span class="he">חוה</span> means: to prostrate oneself in worship (as to God, or another deity) or submission (as to a king)

* Since <span class="he">חָוָה </span> is a 3ה verb, it will consistently exhibit the distinctive 3ה endings
    * <span class="he">הִשְׁתַּחֲוָה</span> - HstP3ms - he worshipped
    * <span class="he">תִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶה</span> - HstI2ms - you will worship
    * <span class="he">הִשְׁתַּחֲווּ</span> - HstM2mp/HstP3mp - (you all) worship!/they worshipped
    * <span class="he">הִשְׁתַּחֲוֹת</span> - Hst∞ - to worship, to bow down
    * <span class="he">מִשְׁתַּחֲוֶה</span> - HstPtms - worshiping, bowing down
    
* Bible Examples:
    * <span class="he">וְהִשְׁתַּחֲו֧וּ לַיהוָ֛ה</span>  - (and) they will worship Adonai (Isa 27:13)
    * <span class="he">וַיִּשְׁתַּחוּ אַבְרָהָם לִפְנֵי עַם הָאָרֶץ</span> - (and) Abraham bowed down before the people of the land (Gen 23:12)
    * <span class="he">וְנִשְׁתַּחֲוֶה וְנָשׁוּבָה אֲלֵיכֶם</span> - (and) we will worship, and we will return to you (Gen 22:5)
