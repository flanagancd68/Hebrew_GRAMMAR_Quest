# Conclusion {-}

We would like to take a moment and recap all that you have accomplished in His strength.  Each section will also have tips and references on where you can go next.

* Vocabulary
    * What you have accomplished: 570 of the most common Biblical Hebrew words committed to memory!
    * Where you can go next: Continue to grow your vocabulary, both by isolated word memorization, such as by learning the top 1000 (or more) Biblical Hebrew words and, of course, by continuing to read your Hebrew Bible.  For word memorization, there are modules on Memrise and Anki that are free (these are not affiliated with Holy Language Institute)
* Bible Verses
    * _What you have accomplished_:
    * _Where you can go next_:
* Hebrew Quest Study Passages (optional track)
    * _What you have accomplished_: You have studied 20 distinct passages, most of which were full chapters of the Hebrew Bible or passages from the Delitsch Hebrew New Testament.  You have also completed the 17-lesson "Premium Proverbs" study.
    * _Where you can go next_:
        * Complete _Hebrew Quest_ if you have not already done so!
        * After _Hebrew Quest_, review Izzy's [Hebrew Verses](https://holylanguage.com/verses.html) studies.  Hebrew Verses picks up where Hebrew Quest left off.
* Ruth
    * _What you have accomplished_: You have skimmed, if not read entirely through, Ruth Chapter one at least 35 times and written your own translations.
    * _Where you can go next_: INTERMEDIATE HEBREW!
        * You can review [Dr. Beckman's Notes on Ruth](./images/00_Ruth_notes.pdf){target="_blank"}
    * We can recommend two Intermediate Hebrew books:
        * [A Workbook for Intermediate Hebrew](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825423902/&tag=holylanginst-20){target="_blank"}, by Robert B. Chisholm, Jr., which contains a verse by verse expositional grammar study through the books of Ruth and Jonah
        * The same author has [From Exegesis to Exposition: A Practical Guide to Using Biblical Hebrew](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009UOG4N4/&tag=holylanginst-20){target="_blank"}




**Next steps**: Continue with Intermediate Hebrew!
