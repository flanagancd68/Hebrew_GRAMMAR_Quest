## What is the difference between Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest? {- #difference}

* Both courses are born of the same Holy Language Learning philosophy: the optimal method to interact with the Sacred Scriptures is by *doing*
* Hebrew Quest was intentionally designed to get students into Hebrew texts with as little "grammar" as possible
* Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to fill a gap for those students who want to know more about the inner workings of Hebrew but wish to do so in a fun, low-pressure format (as opposed to taking a formal Hebrew course or trying to read an academic-level textbook on their own)
* Also, we know that everyone learns a little differently
    * Many can view the 40 lessons of Hebrew Quest, and they "get it" concerning Hebrew
    * Others may have found themselves getting stuck on the "grammar" sections of Hebrew Quest and need some more in-depth grammar preparation before returning to the study passages
    * Still others made it through some or all of Hebrew Quest and have a desire to know more
* As we said in the [introduction](#preface), wherever you find yourself, if you are interested in digging deeper, you have come to the right place!

## Do I need to have completed Hebrew Quest before I start Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest? {-}

* Emphatically - **No!** 
    * This grammar course starts from the beginning (with learning the Aleph-bet) and assumes no prior knowledge of Hebrew
* With that said, the more of Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more comfortable you may find it is to work through the grammar material

* If we were to categorize as "good," "better," "best" in terms of Hebrew Quest completion, here's what we would say:
    * **Good**: 
        * You have completed some or no Hebrew Quest lessons  
        * This means that the first three lessons of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest might take you a little longer, but once you have that foundation, you'll be up to speed
    * **Better**: 
        * You have completed through Hebrew Quest Lesson 12 (the Aleph-bet and Vowels)  
        * This means the first three lessons will go a little more quickly for you
    * **Best**: 
        * You have completed through Lesson 15 (verbs) and beyond
        * This means that more of the concepts presented in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will tend to be things you have heard before versus brand new

## When I complete this course, should I go back and finish Hebrew Quest? {-}

* **ABSOLUTELY!**
* In fact, the most logical next step after completing a first-year Hebrew grammar course is to dig into the Scriptures and start reading  
* Hebrew Quest, starting with Lesson 16, is all about reading Hebrew<small>^[<small>Although, with your more in-depth knowledge, you may be able to go a little faster. If the Hebrew Quest videos are too slow for you, click the "Settings" gear icon in the bottom right corner of the video, click "Speed," and then select a faster speed.</small>]</small>
* To say it differently, Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest complement one another in a circular (and maybe slightly paradoxical!) form:
    * The more Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, and
    * The more Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew Quest
    * Either way, you can't go wrong!

## I haven't started either course.  Which should I do first? {-}

WHich one are you more interested in?  It's more important to pick one, jump in, and start learning Hebrew. 
* If the word "grammar" makes your stomach churn, then start with **Hebrew Quest**.  
* If you feel like you might want to build of a traditional foundation, then start with **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest".

## I really don't know.  Can you just tell me where to start? {-}

OK! Here's a sequence we might recommend:

* Do the first 11 lessons of **Hebrew Quest** - this will take you in-depth through the Aleph-bet, not just academically but spiritually.
* After you learn the Aleph-bet, give **Hebrew Quest** Lessons 12-15 a try.  
    * If the grammar pieces are clicking, then definitely go on to lesson 16 and the study passages.  You always have the option starting this course at anytime.
    * Conversely, we've found that a lot of folks get stuck on these lessons  If this is you, then know you're one of the reasons we designed this grammar course. You might want to pause **Hebrew Quest**, and immediately jump into **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest**
    
Whichever direction you take, we would encourage you to ultimately complete both **Hebrew Quest** and **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest**.
