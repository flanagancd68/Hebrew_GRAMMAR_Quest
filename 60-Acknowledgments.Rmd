All honor and glory to Yeshua, our Lord.  שֵׁם יְהוָה אֶקְרָא


Our thanks to Dr. Gary Pratico and Dr. Myles Van Pelt for <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u>, the seminary textbook that inspired the format of **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest**.  We encourage any of our students who wish to go further with Hebrew grammar to purchase the textbook or any related materials.

Additionally, our thanks to Dr. John Beckman for making his extensive library of materials to accompany <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> freely available for reuse under CC-BY-SA.

Yihui Xie is the genius who developed the [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) tool, which is the engine behind publishing this interactive book.  Without Bookdown, we would not have been able to achieve those bullet points listed on the [What we wanted in our course](#our_course) page related to the ease of lifting the project and making it available to our subscribers for free, while maintaining a professional look.

Finally, we thank YOU for your interest in this course!
