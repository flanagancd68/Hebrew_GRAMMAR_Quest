* DO: `File | Make a copy` to store in your local Google Drive so you can highlight and edit

1. BEFORE WATCHING THE VIDEO, read through the passage on your own straight through one time - pick up as much as you can
2. Now re-read the passage critically
    1. Highlight any words you do not know and look them up in a [lexicon](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}
    2. Parse as many verbs as you can
    3. Sketch out a translation - there is a blank line between each verse
3. Now, using your marked-up copy of the passage, [watch Izzy's _Hebrew Quest_ video (video opens in a new tab)](https://holylanguage.com/NAME.php){target="_blank"}
4. After the video, assess your translation.  How close was it.
5. How did the Ruach HaQodesh speak to you through the passage.

Optionally, as we discussed in Lesson 17, you may complete the passage memorization in the separate `Anki` deck, or in Memrise [here](https://app.memrise.com/course/5406435/hebrew-quest-lessons-1-to-40/##/garden/learn/?source_element=level_details_session&source_screen=level_details){target="_blank}.
