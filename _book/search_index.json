In fact, knowing the gutturals and how they behave will turn out to be one of the most important facets of Hebrew. Gutturals are everywhere. We like to say that the gutturals will be our problem children because they tend not to play nice with the other Hebrew rules. There are four proper gutturals. Aleph, Hei, CHET and AYIN. These are in the darker red above. The letter resh  is not formally a guttural, but since it cant decide whether to behave or not. it is often grouped in as a guttural. Resh is the letter in orange above. Sometimes Resh is a good letter and gets along with the other Hebrew rules and other times its a naughty letter that causes trouble. The good news is this bad boy behavior of the gutturals and Resh is entirely predictable.

There is one other major difference between Sephardic and Seminary pronunciation, which is how to pronounce . In academia, the consonant receives the w sound and is called Waw. In most non-academic circles, it receives the v sound and is pronounced vav. For the most part, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will follow the Sephardic pronunciation Some terms in the world of Hebrew grammar are so common, we are not going to try to fight them. The reason for this is that if you use a Bible Study software package, you are much more likely to encounter the w versions. Examples: We will say shewa and not sheva (Lesson 2) You may see wayyiqtol and not vayyiqtol (verbs) There is a concept called the vav/waw consecutive - when we get to verbs, we will learn some shorthand.

Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to be self-directed and (mostly) stress-free; by design, it will not have the accountability and rigor of a traditional academic program You will spend many hours on this course - we believe it will be a tremendous investment you can make for the kingdom and the impact you can have on others; when you start to see your knowledge building up in Anki, we believe you will find it rewarding and perhaps even fun as well Those who seeking more of an academic/seminary type of setting might fare better with a traditional, instructor-led, Hebrew course What if I am a Bible teacher? Should I take this course? We believe this course, in conjunction with Hebrew Quest, would prepare a pastor or teacher of a traditional Christian congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text to be able to exegete and communicate higher-level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience Additionally, for those who have had first-year Hebrew at seminary (perhaps many years ago) but found it meaningless to their vocation, or for those pastors/teachers who may have never taken a grammar course in Hebrew, our prayer is that this course will give new life to Hebrew application in that persons teaching ministry Conversely, if you are leading a congregation sophisticated with Hebrew and will be frequently reading from Torah, such as at a synagogue, you may benefit from formal Hebrew training instead of, or in addition to Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.
