\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item Sharper comprehension of the Bible

\item Clearer understanding of biblical application

\item More effective communication of truth to others

\item A framework for better memory of biblical events

\item Greater confidence in the Word of God—having seen the places the Bible speaks of

\item More vibrant spiritual life and deeper love for God (99\% of those who go affirm this)

\item Learning the Word of God will all your senses

\item Seeing the Bible when you read it for the rest of your life

\item Experiencing a dimension of authenticity and history to your faith you could gain no other way

\item A window of opportunity that may not last (the political situation is ideal for tourism now)

\end{enumerate}

\par
Walking the land of Israel has provided me with a deeper appreciation of God as Lord of world history and of seemingly minor details—both of which bring comfort to my life.
\par
I am confident it can do the same for you.}
