# (PART) Nouns, Prepositions, Pronouns {-}

# Hebrew Nouns {.Nouns}



> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must understand how nouns are formed, how they are pluralized, and how to look words up in a dictionary.


Nouns consist of a person, place, thing, or idea and can be singular or plural.  Hebrew also introduces the concept of "gender."  This lesson will review aspects of the Hebrew noun with specific attention focused on pluralization rules.

::: {.infobox .map}
**LESSON ITINERARY**

1. Understand Noun Gender and Number
2. Examine singular noun endings and "endingless" nouns for both Masculine and Feminine nouns
3. Examine endings for plural and dual nouns
4. Identify special dual forms
6. Examine other/irregular Pluralization
7. Describe the Rule of Sheva
1. Define what is meant by "Lexical Form"
:::

::: {.infobox .stop}
EQUIPMENT CHECK

Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

* Vowel and syllable preference
* The rules for Silent Sheva and Vocal Sheva
:::

Additionally, starting with this lesson, we will invoke the shorthand we've been learning in Anki (e.g., MP = Masculine Plural, FS = Feminine singular).

</div>

## Gender and Number {#gender_number}

* All Hebrew nouns have Gender and Number
* Gender
    * The "gender" sometimes does, but usually does not, have anything to do with biological gender.  
    * <span class="he">סֵ֫פֶר</span> is masculine (M), while <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span>  is feminine (F). There is nothing inherently masculine about books, nor is there anything feminine about laws or instructions
    * The gender of a noun never changes
* Number
    * A noun is either singular (S), plural (P), or less frequently, dual (D)
        * Dual is precisely two of something
        * Apart from the words "pair" or "both", English doesn't have too many dual forms
        * In Hebrew, typically paired body parts are in the dual form
    * The number of a noun CAN change
    * A word's ending indicates the number
* Person
    * In Unit 3 (Verbs), we will introduce the concept of "person"  
        * Collectively, when you see "PGN" in grammar, this refers to "person, gender, and number"; e.g., "3MS" means "3rd person, masculine, singular".


##Parsing vs. Inflecting

* Many Hebrew grammar books expect students to know how to pluralize nouns in writing
    * When we take a base word and do something with it, such as change its gender or number, we call that _inflecting_ the word
* _Parsing_ is somewhat of the opposite concept
    * When we take an inflected word and break it down into its base form, we call that _parsing_
* Reading the Hebrew Bible does not require you to inflect a noun or a verb
* Reading the Bible **does** require you to parse a word
* When we parse a word, we identify the lexical form, and the inflected person, gender, and number to understand what the word is communicating to us
    * Or, if we don't know what it means, we have at least identified the lexical form so we can look it up in a dictionary
* Beginning with this lesson, you will see an `Anki` chapter called `Workbook`, which will have some activities like parsing

## Singular Noun Endings {#sing_noun_endings}

* Singular
    * Masculine singular (MS): generally are "endingless" (but all MS are endingless and not all endingless are MS); occasionally a MS noun may end in (accented) <span class="he">ה ֶ֫</span>
    * The following words are examples of FS endings:
        * <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span> (most typical)
        * <span class="he">בַּת</span> 
        * <span class="he">תִּפְאֶ֫רֶת</span>  (glory)
        * <span class="he">בְּרִית</span> (covenant)
        * <span class="he">מַלְכּוּת</span> (kingdom)
        * <span class="he">אֶ֫רֶץ</span> (land - endingless, but feminine - less common)<small>^[<small>Not all endingless nouns are MS.  Some common words are endingless but are classified as FS: <span class="he">אֶ֫רֶץ</span> (land), <span class="he">עִיר</span> (city), and <span class="he">אֶ֫בֶן</span> (stone). When this occurs, most vocabulary lists will mark the word as "(F)".</small>]</small>
        
::: {.box .info}
Some students fall into a habit of thinking every word-final ה is feminine.  Remember <span class="he">ה ֶ֫</span>  is masculine
:::

## Plural Noun Endings {#noun_pluralization}

For regular nouns, simply remove the singular ending if there is one, and add the plural ending.

* Plural endings:
    * MP: <span class="he">ים ִ</span> e.g., **<span class="he">סוּסִים</span>** 
        * <span class="he">דָּבָר</span> becomes **<span class="he">דְּבָרִים</span>**
            * A vowel under a non-Guttural will reduce to Vocal Shewa -<span class="he"> דְּבָרִים</span>
            * As we saw in Lesson 3.2,<span class="he"> דְּבָרִים</span> changes from <span class="he">דָבָר </span>because an open propretonic syllable prefers a reduced vowel. 
        * <span class="he">עָנָן</span> becomes **<span class="he">עֲנָנִים</span>** (clouds)
            *  A vowel under a guttural will take a Hateph vowel, usually Hateph Patach - <span class="he">עֲנָנִים</span>
        * <span class="he">כּוֹכָב</span> becomes **<span class="he">כּוֹכָבִים</span>**
            *  An irreducible long vowel will not reduce - <span class="he">כּוֹכָבִים</span> 
    * FP: <span class="he">וֹת</span> e.g., **<span class="he">מְלָכוֹת</span>** (queens)
        * <span class="he">תּוֹרָה</span> becomes **<span class="he">תּוֹרוֹת</span>** 

Under the MP endings above, note the propretonic reduction when the original word is more the one syllable. 

## Dual Noun Endings

* MD: <span class="he">יִם ַ</span> e.g., <span class="he">סוּסַ֫יִם</span> (two horses)
* FD: <span class="he">יִם ַ </span> e.g., <span class="he">יָדַ֫יִם</span> (two hands) or <span class="he">תַ֫יִם ָ</span> as in <span class="he">תּוֹרָתַ֫יִם</span> (two laws)

Occasionally, we will see the defective spelling of the plural and dual endings: <span class="he">סוּסִם תּוֹרֹת</span>


## Special dual forms {#dual_forms}

* Hebrew has four common words that have the unique dual ending 
* These words are usually translated as singular
    * <span class="he">שַׁמַ֫יִם</span> heaven, sky (sometimes "heavens")
    * <span class="he">מִצְרַ֫יִם</span> Egypt
    * <span class="he">מַ֫יִם</span> water (sometimes "waters")
    * <span class="he">פָּנִים</span> face


## Irregular Pluralization  {#irregular_pluralization}

* Like any language, Hebrew has a handful of irregular nouns 
* For example, you won't find <span class="he">נִשִׁים</span> in a dictionary. 
* You need to know the singular form, <span class="he">אִשָּׁה</span>

::: {.box .light} 
Memorize these eight most common pairs:

| S   | Def      | P     | Def.      |
|:-----|:----------|:-------|:-----------|
|<span class="he"> אִישׁ </span>| man      | <span class="he">אֲנָשִׁים</span> | men       |
|<span class="he"> אִשָּׁה </span>| woman    | <span class="he">נָשִׁים</span>  | women     |
|<span class="he"> עִיר </span>| city     | <span class="he">עָרִים </span> | cities    |
|<span class="he"> אָב </span> | father   | <span class="he">אָבוֹת </span> | fathers   |
|<span class="he"> בַּ֫יִת</span> | house    | <span class="he">בָּתִּים </span> | houses    |
|<span class="he"> בַּת</span>  | daughter | <span class="he">בָּנוֹת </span> | daughters |
|<span class="he"> בֵּן</span>  | son      | <span class="he">בָּנִים </span> | sons      |
|<span class="he"> יוֹם</span> | day      | <span class="he">יָמִים </span> | day       |
:::

* The plural forms retain the gender of their singular noun
* <span class="he">אָבוֹת</span> is still masculine,  and <span class="he">נָשִׁים</span> is still feminine, despite the plural endings.

::: {.box .info}

When you see an _internal_ (not word-final) tsere+yod, as in<span class="he"> בָּתִּים</span>, the vowel pattern in the 'original' word was likely the accented-patach-yod-hiriq diphthong, as in <span class="he">בַּ֫יִת</span>.
:::

The next two categories of irregular words are more straightforward:

### Segholate Nouns follow a standard vowel pattern when pluralizing {-}

* Did you notice that the words <span class="he">דֶּ֫רֶךְ</span>  and <span class="he">סֵ֫פֶר</span> have the accent is on the first syllable?
* Many two-syllable words accented on the penult are classified as _Segholate_ nouns.  
* They get this name because frequently, though not always, there are two Seghol vowels. <span class="he">נַ֫עַר</span>  (boy, youth) is a Segholate noun even though it doesn't have any Seghol vowels.

::: {.box .info}
If a plural word has Vocal Sheva/Hateph under the first consonant and Qamets under the second, with the normal MP or FP ending, the word is likely a Segholate noun.
:::

* <span class="he">מֶ֫לֶךְ</span> to <span class="he">מְלָכִים</span>
* <span class="he">סֵ֫פֶר</span> to <span class="he">סְפָרִים</span>
* <span class="he">נַ֫עַר</span> to <span class="he">נְעָרִים</span>

### Geminate Words take a Daghesh Forte {-}

_Geminate_ (from the Latin for "twins") words appear to have two visible letters (which we call "biconsonantal"), but at one point the second consonant appeared twice.  Example <span class="he">עַם</span> (people) was once *<span class="he">עמם</span>.
The lexical form drops the extra consonant.

::: {.box .info}
When we pluralize a Geminate word, the "twin" letter "reappears" but as a Daghesh Forte instead of a consonant.  So in our example,<span class="he"> עַם</span> becomes <span class="he">עַמִּים</span> (peoples).
:::

The reason we don't have a Daghesh Forte in עַם is that **the last consonant of a word rejects the Daghesh Forte when it has no vowel.**

## Rule of Sheva {#rules_sheva}

* Hebrew does not allow two reduced vowels in a row to remain (or "stand")
    * If you see two Sheva in a row in the text, the first one must be Silent
    * We remember the reduced vowels are _Vocal_ Sheva, Hateph Patach, Hateph Seghol, and Hateph Qamets Hatuf
* Sometimes, according to grammar rules, we end up with a scenario where we would have two reduced vowels such as two Vocal Sheva, back to back
* The "Rule of Sheva" defines what happens to resolve: when two reduced vowels occur in a row, the first becomes short
* It is important to recognize when a word has vowels modified because of the Rule of Sheva
    * If we see the combination Hireq+Sheva, the word was _likely_ two consecutive Vocal Sheva before the Rule of Sheva was applied
    * If we see a short vowel under a guttural followed by Sheva (or vice-versa) the short vowel was originally the Hateph vowel in the same class as the short vowel

::: {.box .light}
RULE OF SHEVA

| Type | After Rule of Sheva | Before*<small>^[<small>When you see an asterisk in the context of a word form, it means this form is impossible.  The form is being shown for illustrative purposes only.</small>]</small>
| :-: | :-: | :-:
| Strong | <span class="he">קִטְ</span><small>^[<small>Hebrew Grammars have what are called "paradigm words" to represent any combination of consonants meeting the patter. קטל is a paradigm for any three strong (non-guttural) letters, עמד represents any guttural in the first position, and בחר represents any guttural in the second position.  The examples use these paradigm words.</small>]</small> | <span class="he">קְטְ</span>*
| Yod | <span class="he">קִי</span> | <span class="he">קְיְ</span>*
| Patach/Sheva | <span class="he">עַמְ</span> | <span class="he">עֲמְ</span>*
| Seghol/Sheva | <span class="he">עֶמְ</span> | <span class="he">עֱמְ</span>*
| Sheva/Patach | <span class="he">בַּחֲ</span> | <span class="he">בְּחֲ</span>*
| Sheva/Seghol | <span class="he">בֶּחֱ</span> | <span class="he">בְּחֱ</span>*

:::

* Note the unique situation above when the second consonant is a Yod; this occurs frequently
* When a prefix is added to <span class="he">אלֹהִים</span> and the Tetragramaton, the vowel changes are irregular:
    * With <span class="he">אלֹהִים</span> the aleph becomes quiescent after a prefix:
        * <span class="he">אלֹהִים + לְ = לֵאלֹהִים</span>
    * With the Tetragramaton, the prefixed letter with take a Patach, with nothing under the Yod:
        *  <span class="he">בַיהוָה</span>

::: {.box .info}
You may be wondering why you need to know this

Understanding that a syllable may have "originally" had a reduced vowel is an important clue when it comes to translating and parsing.  If you're 'foggy' now, hang in there.  It will make sense in a bit!
:::

## Lexical Form {#lexical_form}

::: {.box .map}
The Lexical Form is the dictionary version of the word.
:::

* English examples:
    * "Oxen" may not be its own entry, but you would find it under "ox"
    * You may not find "went," but you would find "go"
* Hebrew dictionaries (called "Lexicons" in academia) work the same way
    * For nouns, the Lexical Form is the SINGULAR version of the noun
* Below is how to go from a plural noun to the singular, Lexical form (assuming you didn't already know the singular Lexical Form):
    1. Drop the plural or dual ending
    2. Perhaps add a Feminine Singular ending (usually ה ָ ), or less frequently, ה ֶ for Masculine Singular
    3. For Geiminate nouns, drop the Dagesh Forte when it lacks a vowel
    4. Often change vowels if no singular ending - reduced vowels often become regular vowels but vowel letters do not change

## Anki {-}

* `Lesson 04 A. Vocab`
* `Lesson 04 B. Grammar` 
* `Lesson 04 C. Workbook` 
    * With Lesson 4, we are gradually increasing the depth of work in `Anki`
    * The `Workbook` will have short activities such as translation examples of concepts taught in the lesson and word "parsing"
    * When we parse a Hebrew word, we identify three things:
        * the Person (if applicable), Number and Gender of the word
        * the Lexical form
        * the definition of the original word
    * For example if the instruction is to parse <span class="he">שִׁירִים</span>  , we would respond with: "MP שִׁיר  Songs"
    * You may not know every word -
        * **That is the point of this exercise!**  
        * As you read your Hebrew Bible, you will invariably come across words you don't know.  
        * You will need to be able to break down a word into its Lexical form so you can look it up
        * In the [appendix](#lexicon), we have links to some lexicons (dictionaries) you may use with this course.  You can download an abridged version [here](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"} 
    * As we continue to advance, future lessons will incorporate additional aspects into our parsing activities such as verb conjugation.
* `Lesson 04 D. Study Verses`
    * We will continue with study verses that provide examples of the Lesson's vocabulary
    * Hints will be provided for less familiar verbs

## Ruth Pursuit {-}        

::: {.box .map}
YOUR QUEST

1. Find one regular singular segholate noun in V1.  In this verse there is also a segholate noun with a propositional prefix that we haven't studied yet; this world also takes on vowel changes but we'll cover that in a few lessons (yellow)
2. Find all words regular masculine plural in the chapter (pink). Some words are prefixed with the definite article, which we will cover in the next lesson.  Also find all regular Feminine plural nouns in the chapter (pink).  One of the words in verses 2-6 has a MP ending but is actually an irregular FP.  Highlight this word in (green).
    * Be sure to research any words you don't know. HLI has a [lexicon available here.](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}
3. <span class="he">כַלֹּתֶיהָ
</span> is a word meaning her daughters-in-law (in verse 22, this word is in the singular).  It comes from a verb meaning "finish" or "end" (we'll let you ponder that!). Find all four examples of these feminine nouns, including one with the "and" prefix (grey)
4. Find the vocabulary word <span class="he">עִיר</span>. In Ruth 1, it appears as <span class="he">הָעִיר</span>. In the next lesson, we will learn about the prefix ה

# X Conclusion {-}

We would like to take a moment and recap all that you have accomplished in His strength.  Each section will also have tips and references on where you can go next.



## Hebrew Quest Study Passages {-}

You have studied 20 distinct passages, most of which were full chapters of the Hebrew Bible or passages from the Delitsch Hebrew New Testament.  You have also completed the 17-lesson "Premium Proverbs" study.

**Next steps**: If you haven't yet finished _Hebrew Quest_ this is where you should head next.  

## Ruth Pursuit - Intermediate Hebrew {-}   

* You have skimmed, if not read entirely through, Ruth Chapter one at least 35 times!

**Next steps**: Continue with Intermediate Hebrew!

* You can review [Dr. Beckman's Notes on Ruth](./images/00_Ruth_notes.pdf){target="_blank"}
* We can recommend two Intermediate Hebrew books:
    * [A Workbook for Intermediate Hebrew](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825423902/&tag=holylanginst-20){target="_blank"}, by Robert B. Chisholm, Jr., which contains a verse by verse expositional grammar study through the books of Ruth and Jonah
    * The same author has [From Exegesis to Exposition: A practical Guide to Using Biblical Hebrew](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009UOG4N4/&tag=holylanginst-20){target="_blank"}

# Lexicon

<img src="images/lexicon.jpg" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> have created an abridged Lexicon to accompany this course.  This document is nice as vocabulary words are indexed to the Lesson #, and irregular plural forms and selected construct forms are also included.

[Open/download BBH Lexicon](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"}

You are also encouraged to check out the Lexicon resources in the [Holy Language Heritage Library](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}.  They are much more exhaustive.

# Acknowledgments {-}

All honor and glory to Yeshua, our Lord.  שֵׁם יְהוָה אֶקְרָא


Our thanks to Dr. Gary Pratico and Dr. Myles Van Pelt for <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u>, the seminary textbook that inspired the format of **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest**.  We encourage any of our students who wish to go further with Hebrew grammar to purchase the textbook or any related materials.

Additionally, our thanks to Dr. John Beckman for making his extensive library of materials to accompany <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> freely available for reuse under CC-BY-SA.

Yihui Xie is the genius who developed the [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) tool, which is the engine behind publishing this interactive book.  Without Bookdown, we would not have been able to achieve those bullet points listed on the [What we wanted in our course](#our_course) page related to the ease of lifting the project and making it available to our subscribers for free, while maintaining a professional look.

Finally, we thank YOU for your interest in this course!

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
