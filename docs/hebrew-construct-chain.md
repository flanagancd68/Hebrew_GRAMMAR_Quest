# Hebrew Construct Chain {.ConstructChain}

> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to identify words in the construct state.

You might be surprised to learn that you are already familiar with at least one Hebrew Construct chain.

<span class="he">בֵּית לֶחֶם</span>, the word you probably know as "Bethlehem", literally means "house of bread" and is a Hebrew construct chain.  The first thing you might notice is that <span class="he">בַּ֫יִת</span>, the word for "house", is spelled a little differently.  The reason for this is that <span class="he">בֵּית</span> is in what we call a "construct" form or state.  

* <span class="he">בַּ֫יִת</span> means "house", and is said to be in "absolute" form
* <span class="he">בֵּית</span> means "house of", and is said to be in "construct" form

In this lesson, we will discuss the parameters of a Hebrew construct chain.  Keep in mind that we do not need to spell the construct state for a given noun.  Our primary goal is to *recognize* it and translate it adequately when we read our Bibles.

::: {.infobox}
**LESSON ITINERARY**

1. Describe what is meant by the term "construct chain"
2. Define a Hebrew construct chain 
3. Review and identify what makes a word definite 
4. Determine the definiteness of a chain
5. Differentiate between absolute state and construct state words
:::

::: {.box .stop}
**EQUIPMENT CHECK**

Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

* The pronominal suffixes (you have them memorized)
* Define Type 1 vs Type 2 suffixes

## What is a Construct Chain?

A construct chain consists of at least two nouns linked together.  

The first important thing to know about a Hebrew construct chain is this:

> The very last noun in the chain is said to be in the "absolute state".  All words in the chain before the absolute noun are said to be in "construct state."

* Back to <span class="he">בֵּית לֶחֶם</span>, "house of bread" 
    * "bread" would be in the absolute state
    * "house of" is in the construct state
    * The entire phrase, with one and only one absolute noun and one or more construct nouns, would be called a "construct chain."  

::: {.box .light}
The purpose of the chain is to describe the **first** _noun_ in the chain.  
:::

* It might be reasonable to think that the chain would be describing the noun in the absolute state, but that is not the case.  
* In <span class="he">בֵּית לֶחֶם</span>, we are describing the house, not the bread  
* Note that we said the first NOUN in the chain
    * If there were a substantival adjective as the first word, e.g. "wise of heart", the chain is describing "heart" not "wise".  
    * A chain describes the first NOUN in the chain, not necessarily the first word in the chain.

In English, we would typically add the word "of" after each word in the construct state.  
    * We could say "the king's son" or the "son of the king," and both would mean the same thing
    * Translating a construct word as "of" is a _starting point_ and not a hard-and-fast requirement

Just like we may add `'s`, Hebrew has different spelling for nouns in construct.  The absolute noun is the "normal" spelling and meaning.


## What makes a construct chain

What makes a Hebrew construct chain different is that nothing else comes between the words of the chain.  

* In English, we could add an adjective like "the servant of the _wicked_ son of the king."
* In Hebrew, any adjectives must come after the whole chain.  
* A literal translation would look like: "servant of son of the king the wicked."
* To resolve, we would need to go back and determine which word the adjective modifies by matching the gender and number.
* In the example above, there is ambiguity.  Without more context, it is impossible to determine which of the three men is the wicked one.
* Translating is more straightforward when the nouns in the construct chain are of a mixed number or gender.
    * For example: "the wife of David the strong the smart, the beautiful."
        * If "strong" and "beautiful" were FS then we know they are referring to David's wife.
        * If "smart" was MS, we know it is referring to David.
        * The sentence translation would be clear: "The strong and beautiful wife of smart David."

## Review: what makes a word definite 

Construct Chains have strict rules regarding definiteness, so now would be a good time to refresh our list of what makes a noun definite in light of this lesson and Lesson 9.

A word is definite if it:

* Has the article - <span class="he">הַמֶּלֶךְ</span>
* Has a pronominal suffix - <span class="he">מַלְכִּי</span>
* Is a proper noun - <span class="he">דָּוִיד</span>
* Is in a construct chain where the last, absolute, word is definite - <span class="he">בֶּן הַמֶּלֶךְ</span> = THE son of the king

This brings us to a critical concept about construct chains:

::: {.box .light}
Nouns in construct state NEVER take the article.
:::

Even though a noun in construct may not have the definite article, it is deemed definite when the last word (the absolute noun) is definite.  We explain more on the next page.

## The Absolute noun establishes the definiteness of a chain

A construct chain is either entirely definite, or entirely indefinite and it is the last, absolute, word that defines whether the chain is definite or indefinite.

* <span class="he">בֶּן הַמֶּלֶךְ</span> = the son of the king
* <span class="he">בֶּן מֶלֶךְ</span> = a son of a king

> A construct chain cannot mix definite and indefinite.

You will never see "a son of the king" or "the son of a king" in a construct chain.  It's only one or the other.

There are examples in the Bible of mixing definiteness and indefiniteness but these are not done using construct chains<small>^[<small><span class="he">מִ֭שְׁלֵי שְׁלֹמֹ֣ה</span> is a construct chain that means "THE proverbs of Solomon."<span class="he">מִזְמ֗וֹר לְדָ֫וִ֥ד</span> means "a psalm of (to) David", but this is not a construct chain.</small>]</small>.


## How to Recognize a Construct Chain

The following are characteristics of nouns in the construct state:

* Never an article
* Never a pronominal suffix
* Never a unaccented long vowel unless it is a vowel letter 
    * We will see Tsere-yod and Holem-Vav
    * We will not see Holem, Qamets, or Tsere
    * We will see _accented_ long vowels in the penult<small>^[<small>That is the next to last syllable position.</small>]</small> - <span class="he">סֵ֫פֶר</span>
* No diphthong (will see Tsere+Yod or Holem-Vav)
* May have a reduced vowel in the penult
* Noun endings may change (next page)
* Two nouns connected by maqqef is a construct chain
    * <span class="he">כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה</span> = The glory of the LORD

A good rule:

::: {.box .light}
Long vowel, not accented, not a vowel letter = absolute
:::

## Identifying Construct state by Noun Endings

Nouns in construct often sometimes (but will not always) change endings.  The table below shows the Absolute ending and then the difference in the Construct form. 


```r
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/10_construct_endings.png")
```

<img src="images/10_construct_endings.png" width="300pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Other nouns may not change endings but will exhibit a loss of long vowels as discussed in the previous section.

::: {.box .light}
Word-final Tsere+Yod is diagnostic of Plural and Dual construct forms
:::


## Construct Chain Summary

* Remember the rules for what makes a noun definite.  This will help you determine whether the entire construct chain is definite or indefinite (for it can only be entirely definite or entirely indefinite)
    * "THE son of the queen" OR "A son of a queen"
* All words except for the last are in the "construct state"
    * No article or pronominal suffix
    * Long vowels are limited
        * ("Long vowel, not a vowel letter = Absolute" - Dr. Beckman)
    * No diphthong
    * Review ending changes chart
        * Tsere+yod is a very common ending for a masculine plural construct noun
    * A reduced vowel in the penult is usually construct - <span class="he">נְבִיא</span>
    * Noun with Maqqef is construct - <span class="he">בֶּן־</span>

There are four extremely common constructs in the Bible so we must be able to recognize them.  These will be reviewed in `Anki`.

* <span class="he">כָּל־</span> - all of
* <span class="he">אֲבִי־</span> = father of
* <span class="he">אֲחִי־</span> = brother of
* <span class="he">אֵ֫שֶׁת־</span> = wife of

# Lexicon

<img src="images/lexicon.jpg" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> have created an abridged Lexicon to accompany this course.  This document is nice as vocabulary words are indexed to the Lesson #, and irregular plural forms and selected construct forms are also included.

[Open/download BBH Lexicon](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"}

You are also encouraged to check out the Lexicon resources in the [Holy Language Heritage Library](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}.  They are much more exhaustive.

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
