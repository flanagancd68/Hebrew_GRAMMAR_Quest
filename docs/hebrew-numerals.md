# Hebrew Numerals

> In order to comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to figure out numbers, with or without a dictionary, when we encounter them in the Bible


You have worked very hard on the first 10 lessons!  Way to go!  While a discussion on numbers and counting is often interweaved in a discussion with the Aleph-Bet, the authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u>, wisely in our opinion, strategically placed a necessary but lighter discussion on numerals right here in Lesson 11.  We are emerging from what may be a lot of foggy concepts with all of the noun, pronoun, and adjective concepts in lessons 4-10 (particularly Lessons 8-10).  The bulk of the work in this Lesson will be in `Anki` learning numbers from _Hebrew Quest_.

For the next 25 lessons we will be exclusively focused on the Hebrew verbal system and -- the entire point of this course -- reading and understanding Scripture.

Enjoy this brief lesson on numbers!

::: {.infobox .map}
**LESSON ITINERARY** 

1. The Biblical text always spells out numbers
2. Notes and footnotes use symbols for numbers
3. Be Familiar with Hebrew Ordinal Numbers - First through Tenth
4. Hebrew Cardinal Numbers
5. Digits 1 and 2 match the gender of the noun
6. Digits 3-10 take the opposite gender of the noun
7. Learn the Cardinal Numbers Above 10
:::

::: {.box .stop}
**EQUIPMENT CHECK**

Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

* The difference between construct and absolute states

## First Thought {-}

Give Him praise that you are among those counted as His talmidim (disciples)!

## The Biblical text always spells out numbers

There is not a lot of elaboration needed except to note that this is the case.  You will not see "1", "200", or "969", either in modern symbols or in Rabbinic symbols (using the Aleph-bet) in the Hebrew text.  

<span class="he">כָּל־יְמֵי מְתוּשֶׁלַח **תֵּשַׁע וְשִׁשִּׁים שָׁנָה וּתְשַׁע**</span>

"all the days of Methuselah (were) **nine and sixty years (i.e 960) and nine (i.e. 969)**."

## Notes and footnotes use symbols for numbers

You may come across a system of counting that uses numerical values for each of the Hebrew letters.  This is interesting and the Rabbis have a lot of fun with comparing words that have identical numerical values.

* א ב ג ד ה ו ז ח ת represent 1-9
* י כ ל מ נ ס ע פ צ represent 10-90 by tens
    * So to say 33, would be 30 and 3 = לג or often ל״ג, with the ״ indicating that this is not a real word
* ק ר ש ת are 100, 200, 300, and 400, then we go to the sofit forms ך ם ן ף ץ for 500-900
* In some reckonings, a series of dots or diamonds above the letters, or ’ is used for numbers above 999.  For example 1000 is ’א

Below is Genesis 1:1.

* בראשית פרק א
means "Genesis Chapter 1"
* Next, note the diminished א indicating "1" for the first verse


```r
knitr::include_graphics("images/11.gen0101.png")
```

<img src="images/11.gen0101.png" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Hebrew Ordinal Numbers

* Ordinal numbers denote order.  first, second, third
* In Hebrew, these are attributive adjectives, so they follow the noun and match in gender, number and definiteness (Attributive Always After, Always Agree).
    * <span class="he">יוֹם רִאשׁוֹן</span> or <span class="he">הַיּוֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן</span> = first day or the first day
* To denote the 11th position or higher, we would use cardinal numbers
    * We are dependent on the context of the passage to indicate whether the number is cardinal or ordinal
    * <span class="he">בִּשְׁנַת הָאַרְבָּעִים</span>  = in the year of the forty = in the 40th year

We encourage you to learn the "days of the week" song with Izzy in the video below.

<div class="container">
<iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlfwNNuWgto?t=2545" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

## Cardinal Numbers 1-10

* One is an attributive adjective - it follows its noun and agrees in gender, number and definiteness
    * As we mentioned previously, it is sometimes used as an indefinite article
    * <span class="he">אִישׁ אֵחָד</span> = one man = a man
* Two through Ten are nouns
    * They have both masculine and feminine forms
    * They have absolute and construct forms
* Higher numbers are nouns with no specific gender


### Digits 1 and 2 match the gender of the noun {-}

For example:

* <span class="he">בֵּן אֶחָד</span> = one son
* <span class="he">בַּת אַחַת</span> = one daughter

### Digits 3-10 take the opposite gender of the noun {-}

Additionally they are "singular" even though the noun is plural.  This makes sense when you think that the plural form of 3 is actually the word for 30 (see next section).

For example:

* <span class="he">שְׁלֹשָׁה בָּנִים</span> = three sons
* <span class="he">שְׁלֹשׁ בָּנוֹת</span> = three daughters

The technical term for this is "chiastic concord" (you don't need to know this)

## Cardinal Numbers Above 10

* 11-19
    * 11-12 match gender, 13-19 swap
        * 11 <span class="he">אַחַד אָשָֹר</span>
        * 13 <span class="he">שְׁלֹשָׁה אָשָֹר</span>
* Decades 30 through 90 are spelled as masculine plural of the corresponding 3-9 number
    * 3 = <span class="he">שָׁלֹשׁ</span>  
    * 30 = <span class="he">שְׁלֹשִׁים</span>
* 20 is a bit unusual
    * The word for two is <span class="he">שְׁנַיִם</span> (male) and <span class="he">שְׁתַּיִם</span> (female)
    * Since these words already have a non-singular ending, Hebrew uses the masculine plural of ten
    * <span class="he">עֶשֶׂר<span> is 10
    * <span class="he">עֶשְׂרִים<span> is 20
* 100 is <span class="he">מֵאָה</span>
* 200 is <span class="he">מָאתַיִם</span>, the plural of 100
* 300 is <span class="he">שְׁלֹשׁ מֵאוֹת</span> ("three one hundred" and so forth up to 1000)
    
## Conclusion

This chapter omits many details about numbers and counting.  Our aim was to provide an introduction so that when you encounter numbers in the Bible, you will have some basic familiarity.

If you are interested in going a little deeper, we encourage you to view the complete [Hebrew Quest segment on numerals](https://holylanguage.com/grammar-1.php){target="_blank"}. 

For Hebrew GRAMMAR quest it is sufficient for you to learn the Ordinals (first through 10th - for 1-7 we will learn Izzy's days of the week song) and the Cardinals 1-10, then 20-100 by 10s, and 1000.

There is no quiz and no Anki Workbook for this lesson.  
You are at a very exciting point of the course.  Next week we get into Hebrew Verbs, and your understanding of Hebrew Scripture will start to move into high gear!

# Lexicon

<img src="images/lexicon.jpg" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> have created an abridged Lexicon to accompany this course.  This document is nice as vocabulary words are indexed to the Lesson #, and irregular plural forms and selected construct forms are also included.

[Open/download BBH Lexicon](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"}

You are also encouraged to check out the Lexicon resources in the [Holy Language Heritage Library](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}.  They are much more exhaustive.

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
