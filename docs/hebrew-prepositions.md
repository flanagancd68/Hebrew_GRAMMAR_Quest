# Hebrew Prepositions

> In order to comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to identify prepositions as we read the Text.

Prepositions give us space and context.  Given that much of the Tanach is narrative, prepositions are on almost every page that we read as the authors describe the events to us.  There is one Hebrew word, <span class="he">מִן</span>, that is classified as a preposition but depending on the context can convey a wide array of meanings. 

::: {.infobox .map}
**LESSON ITINERARY**

1. Recognize that a Nun with Silent Sheva becomes a Daghesh Forte
2. Describe Independent and Maqqef prepositions
3. Define Inseparable prepositions
4. Identify when a word with an inseparable preposition also has the definite article
5. Understand how <span class="he">מִן</span> is constructed
6. Define how <span class="he">מִן</span> is used
7. Identify the Definite Direct Object (DDO) marker
:::


::: {.infobox .stop}
**EQUIPMENT CHECK**

Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

* The construction of the definite article, including what happens when the Daghesh Forte is rejected
* The construction of the Vav conjunction
* How Hebrew handles indefinite words
:::

## First Thought {-}

### <span class="he">  בְּיוֹם צָרָתִי אֲדֹנָי דָּרָשְׁתִּי </span> {-}

_In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord  (Psalms 77:3)_

Meditate and celebrate that the Lord is in the midst of our troubles.

The בּ in <span class="he">בְּיוֹם</span> is an example of an "inseparable preposition" that means "in".  We will study various types of prepositions in this lesson.

## Nun with Silent Sheva Becomes Daghesh Forte

You may be wondering what this has to do with prepositions, but stick with us.  It will make sense by the end of the lesson!

Nun is considered a "weak letter" and it has a tendency to drop out of a word under certain scenarios. When the nun appears with a SILENT sheva <span class="he">נְ</span> (or no vowel at all) is one of those times.  You remember how we said that the Daghesh Forte is your friend, because it tells you that something has changed?  

* When then nun drops, whenever possible it will be replaced with a Daghesh Forte.  
* The technical term for this is called "assimilation".   
* To get back to the original/lexical form we would substitute the Daghesh Forte for the nun+sheva


```r
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/06.nun-assimilation.gif")
```

<img src="images/06.nun-assimilation.gif" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is why we spend time talking about when the Daghesh Forte might get rejected.  Do you remember the three times we have studied where the Daghesh Forte may be rejected?  

* Gutturals and Resh (may be compensatory lengthening)
* At the end of a word (may be compensatory lengthening)
* With a SQiN eM LeVY with a Sheva: <span class="he">מִנְקְצֵה* > מִקְּצֵה* > מִקְצֵה</span> (will never be compensatory lengthening)

## Independent and Maqqef prepositions 

Prepositions explains the relationship between its object and something else.  In Hebrew, there are three different types of Hebrew prepositions: independent, Maqqef, and inseparable. 

An _independent preposition_ is a separate word with a space before it and after it.

The preposition comes first, followed by its object (just like English). E.g.,  <span class="he">תַּחַת אֹתוֹ</span> (under it)

_Maqqef_ is a mark like the English hyphen.  They are nearly identical in meaning and appearance except the Hebrew maqqef is raised ־ whereas the English is middle -.  Like the hyphen used to join two English words, the maqqef lets us know that two Hebrew words are closely connected grammatically.

In a _Maqqef preposition_, the maqqef connects a preposition to its object. Again, the preposition comes first.  <span class="he">עַל־מֶלֶךְ</span>.  English prepositions are NOT written this way.  You would never see "on-a-king."

::: {.box .info}
* You may see the same preposition written both with and without the Maqqef.  
* The meaning does not change.  <span class="he">עַל מֶלֶךְ</span> means the same as <span class="he">עַל־מֶלֶךְ</span>
* One notable aspect about the maqqef is that the word loses its accent.  As a result, the vowel that loses its accent may change.
:::

## Inseparable prepositions

Like <span class="he">וְ</span> for the word "and", an inseparable preposition is a one-letter prefix that is affixed to its object. 

Three Hebrew prepositions are **ALWAYS** written this way, usually with a Vocal Sheva under the prepositional letter:


```r
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/05.inseparable.png")
```

<img src="images/05.inseparable.png" width="400pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

::: {.box .info}
A mnemonic to remember these three inseparable prepositions is "buckle"
:::

The first word of the Bible contains an inseparable preposition: <span class="he">בְּרֵאשִׁית</span> = "In (the) beginning".

In the lexical form of these prepositions, there is a vocal sheva vowel under the "buckle" consonant.  If there is a Sheva or Hateph vowel in the next letter, the Rules of Sheva come into play.  Review Lesson 4 if you need to.

* Before another Vocal Sheva, the preposition usually takes a Hireq
* Before a Guttural with a Hateph vowel, the preposition takes the corresponding short vowel
* Note the names of God again receive special treatment: <span class="he">לֵאלֹהִים</span> and <span class="he">לַיהוָה</span>

## The Article and Inseparable Prepositions

Words with both an inseparable preposition AND the article undergo a type of contraction.  

::: {.box .light}
The one-letter preposition replaces the <span class="he">ה</span> of the article. The vowel under the preposition and the daghesh forte (if it is there) are your clues that the word is definite.
:::

For example, note how we would spell "in the field":


```r
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/06.preposition_article.png")
```

<img src="images/06.preposition_article.png" width="800pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For words that keep the pathach and daghesh forte of the article, it is straightforward to determine the article.  The challenge comes when the next letter rejects the Daghesh Forte.

::: {.box .info}
Here's how to tell whether there is the article with a preposition:

* NO ARTICLE if there is a Sheva under the preposition - the article never takes a Sheva
* NO ARTICLE if the short vowel under the preposition can be explained by the Rules of Sheva: 
    * <span class="he">אֲנָשִׁים + לְ = לַאֲנָשִׁים</span> - for men, (not 'for the men')
* ARTICLE if vowel under the preposition is not Sheva and can NOT be explain by the Rule of Sheva: 
    * <span class="he">לַהֵיכָל</span> = for THE temple
:::

Some situations will be ambiguous.  The context will guide us.

## The flexible <span class="he">מִן</span>: construction

There is one preposition that is unique: <span class="he">מִן</span>

It can be a maqqef preposition, as in: <span class="he">מִן־זָהָב</span>, or it can be an inseparable preposition: <span class="he">מִזָּהָב.</span> Both mean "from gold." 

Now you know the reason we began this lesson with a discussion on "nun with a silent sheva." When <span class="he">מִן</span> is an inseparable preposition, the nun assimilates into the following consonant, usually becoming a Daghesh Forte.  This is so frequent that it is just as easy to think of the standard <span class="he">מִנ</span> inseparable preposition form as *Mem+Hireq+Daghesh Forte*:


```r
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/06.preposition_min.jpg")
```

<img src="images/06.preposition_min.jpg" width="100pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


As we know well by know, the Gutturals and Resh reject the Daghesh Forte:

* <span class="he">א צ ה ר</span> have compensatory lengthening so the Hireq becomes Tsere.
* <span class="he">ח</span> has virtual doubling, which as we remember means "virtually no doubling" in that the vowel under the <span class="he">מ</span> remains a Hireq

One last, very important, point to make about this preposition:

::: {.box .light}
Unlike the regular "BucKLe" inseparable prepositions, the <span class="he">ה</span> of the article is RETAINED with <span class="he">מִן</span>: <span class="he">מֶהָאָ֫רֶץ</span> = from the land.
:::

## The flexible <span class="he">מִן</span>: meanings 

<span class="he">מִן</span> occurs 7,592 times in the Bible, so it is important to study its uses.

* The most direct meaning is "from" - <span class="he">מֵהָאָ֫רֶץ</span> from the land
* <span class="he">מִן</span> can also have comparative (think "bigger") and superlative (think "biggest") meanings depending on the context
    * <span class="he">טוֹבָה חָכְמָה מִזָּהָב</span> = wisdom is better *than* gold 
    * <span class="he">קָשָׁה הָעֲבֹדָה מֵהָאֲנָשִׁים</span> = the work is *too* difficult *for* the men
    * <span class="he">עָרוּם מִכֹּל חַיַּת הַשָֹּדֶה ּ</span>  = the *most* clever living thing *of all* the field
* There is also a use called "partive" that denotes a portion or part of something else:
    * <span class="he">מֵהָאֲנָשִׁים</span> may mean "*some* *of* the men" (lit. from the men)

Other uses: 'because', 'by', 'without', 'even', 'namely'.


::: {.box .info}
* This is a word that takes practice to appreciate the various nuanced meanings
* As you are starting out in Hebrew, when you see <span class="he">מִן</span>, start your translation with "from...", but don't be surprised if "from" does not make sense (such as "good the wisdom from the gold")
:::

## The Definite Direct Object marker 

Hebrew has an untranslated word that is often used to mark a direct object that is definite.  It is often abbreviated DDO (Definite Direct Object) marker.

The DDO is spelled <span class="he">תֵא</span> (independent) or <span class="he">תֶא־</span> with a maqqef. the challenge can be that this is the same spelling as the preposition "with".  As both the DDO and preposition can take pronominal suffixes, we will save a discussion of differentiating between the two words for Lesson 9 (see Lesson 9.9 if you can't wait!).

::: {.box .info}
We see the DDO twice in the first verse of the Bible:

<span class="he">בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים *אֵת* הַשָּׁמַיִם *וְאֵת* הָאָרֶץ</span>
:::

## Review and Activities {-}

How are you feeling so far?  Is any component of "the fog" refusing to dissipate? Keep sticking with `Anki` and try to do your reviews at least once daily.

To help with this, we've gone a little bit lighter on the Grammar cards and the Ruth Pursuit for Lesson 6.  While there are some differences, prepositions are used much the same way in Hebrew as they are in English.  There is no sense in creating a lot of busy work.

We would recommend using the time between now and starting Lesson 7 to get caught up and make sure the new concepts start to take hold.  You might notice the intensity pick up starting with the next lesson as we get into some ways Hebrew handles adjectives and pronouns.  Until then, enjoy learning some more of God's work with Izzy in the `Word warm-up`, `Verse warm-up`, and `Anki`.

### `Anki` {-}

* `Lesson 06 A. Vocab`
* `Lesson 06 B. Grammar`
* `Lesson 06 C. Workbook`
    * In this activity, we will have very short passages of scripture that illustrate prepositions.
    * Make sure you look up any words you do not know.  See the [appendix](#lexicon) for links to some lexicons (dictionaries) you may use with this course.  You can download an abridged version [here](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"}.

<img src="images/lexicon.jpg" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> have created an abridged Lexicon to accompany this course.  This document is nice as vocabulary words are indexed to the Lesson #, and irregular plural forms and selected construct forms are also included.

[Open/download BBH Lexicon](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"}

You are also encouraged to check out the Lexicon resources in the [Holy Language Heritage Library](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}.  They are much more exhaustive.

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
