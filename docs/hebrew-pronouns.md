# Hebrew Pronouns

> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to identify pronouns with gender, number and person 

Pronouns are essentially a language's shorthand so we don't have to keep repeating nouns (because saying all of those nouns over and over can really wear you down).

As such, this is an important topic that will take two lessons (8 and 9).  If you want to understand what you're reading, you will need a firm grasp of pronouns to help decipher what is happening in the narrative.

::: {.infobox .map}
**LESSON ITINERARY**

1. Define the phrase "independent personal pronoun"
2. Identify and define Hebrew's relative pronoun
3. Identify Hebrew's interrogative pronouns
4. Distinguish the interrogative particle from the definite article
5. Identify and translate the near and far demonstratives
6. Detect demonstrative adjective use
7. Detect demonstrative pronoun use
:::

::: {.box .stop}
EQUIPMENT CHECK

Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

* Define and translate substantival, attributive, and predicate adjectives (at a summary level)
* How Hebrew inflects adjectives, so we can identify Gender and Number
* The directional ending as compared with the FS ending

::: 

## First Thought {-}

### <span class="he">זֶה הַדֶּרֶךְ לְכוּ בוֹ</span> {-}

_This is the way, walk in it  (Isaiah 30:21)_

Pray that you continually walk in His way, not your own way


<figure>
    <figcaption>Listen to the verse in Hebrew:</figcaption>
    <audio
        controls controlsList="nodownload"
        src="./images/08.is3021.mp3">
            Your browser does not support the
            <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</figure>

The first word in above passage is an example of a "demonstrative pronoun". The first two words are translated, "this is the way".  Contrast "this is the way" with the phrase "this way."  "This way" would be written <span class="he">הַדֶּרֶךְ הַזֶּה</span>.  "This way" is an example of a "demonstrative adjective."  We'll learn about demonstratives in this lesson.

</div>

## Independent Personal Pronoun

Independent personal pronouns are _always_ subjects, meaning they are equivalent to I, you, she, he, it and they in English (NOT me, my, her, him, his)


```r
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/08.sub_pn_table.png")
```

<img src="images/08.sub_pn_table.png" width="400pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

You will work to memorize these in `Anki`.

Notes:

* This is the first time we are officially using all three elements of Person, Gender and Number.  3MS is shorthand for Person = 3rd Person, Gender = Masculine, Number=Singular
* For 1st person, Hebrew, like English, does not distinguish between gender in the first person.  A woman says "I" and a man says "I"
    * <span class="he">אָנֹכִי</span> is considered more formal or emphatic.  It is often translated, "I, myself"
* Note the following memory aids:
    * All 1st person pronouns begin with <span class="he">אנ</span>
    * All 2 begin with accented <span class="he">אַתּ֫</span> - note the Daghesh Forte
    * All 3 begin with accented <span class="he">ה֫</span>
    * All MP end with either <span class="he">מָה</span> or <span class="he">ם.</span> Think "monks" since men are monks
    * All FP end with either <span class="he">נָה</span> or <span class="he">ן.</span> Think "nuns" since women are nuns
    * Who is he? He is she.
* Do not confuse <span class="he">אַתָּה</span> (you 2MS) with <span class="he">עַתָּה</span> (now)
    
## Relative Pronoun <span class="he">אֲשֶׁר</span>

* Hebrew has one general-purpose relative pronoun
* <span class="he">אֲשֶׁר</span> is a vocabulary word for this lesson
* This word does not inflect/the spelling never changes
* It can refer to people (who) or things (that), subjectively (who) or objectively (whom)

Example Deuteronomy 1:1

> <span class="he">אֵלֶּה הַדְּבָרִים *אֲשֶׁר* דִּבֶּר מֹשֶׁה</span>

These are the words *that* Moses spoke

## Interrogative Pronoun

* <span class="he">מִי</span> = who ("Who, me?")
* <span class="he">מָה</span> = what (think of your mom questioning you, "What, ma?")
    * Can also be written as Maqqef - note the vowel shortens <span class="he">מַה־</span>
*   <span class="he">לָמָה</span> = why
    * Remember the familiar verse "<span class="he">אֵלִ֣י אֵ֖לִי לָמָ֣ה עֲזַבְתָּ֑נִי</span> " - My God, my God, WHY have you forsaken me?

Usually these words will appear at the beginning of a clause

## Interrogative Particle <span class="he">הֲ</span>

English has a question mark at the end of a sentence. Hebrew has what is called an interrogative particle at the BEGINNING of a sentence that asks a yes/no question.

Questions that ask who? what? or why? will use the interrogative pronouns.

### Interrogative Particle vs Definite Article {-}

In most cases you will not have trouble differentiating the Article from the Interrogative Particle.  Below are potential sources of ambiguity:

* 1st word of a clause before <span class="he">חָ֫,חָ, הָ, עָ</span>   = both are <span class="he">הֶ</span>
* 1st word of a clause before <span class="he">ה, ח</span> without Qamets or SQiN eM LeVY with Sheva = both are <span class="he">הַ</span>
* In these situations, you guessed it, you will need to let context determine whether a question is being asked.  
* With lots of reading practice, this will get easier.  
* Additionally, the Definite Article is about **300X more common**.


## Near and Far Demonstratives

In English, the near demonstratives are this and these. The far demonstratives are that and those.  Think of "this right here" and "those, over there".

Hebrew has three words to indicate nearness.  We already learned the words to indicate distance - they are the same as the subject pronouns.



```r
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/08.demons_tbl.png")
```

<img src="images/08.demons_tbl.png" width="400pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Demonstrative Adjective 

Demonstratives act as adjectives or as pronouns.

A demonstrative adjective modifies a noun just as an attributive adjective does.  These daughters.

The behavior is a lot like the Attributive use: 

* Always comes after the noun (Dem Adjective Always After)
* Always has the article (Dem. Adjective Always Article)
* Always matches in Gender and Number
    * <span class="he">הָאִשָּׁה הַזֹּאת</span> = this woman (FS)
    * <span class="he">הָאֲנָשִׁים הָהֵם</span>  = those men (MP)

Mnemonic: 

> Demonstrative Adjective Always After noun, Always has Article

## Demonstrative Pronoun


A demonstrative pronoun takes the place of a noun as the subject of a clause.  This is her daughter.

The behavior is a lot like the Predicative use: 

* Always comes before the noun (Pronoun Perpetually Precedes)
* Does NOT have the article (Pronoun dePrived of article)
* Matches Gender and Number
    * <span class="he">זֹאת הַמַּלְכָּה</span>  = this is the queen (FS)
    * <span class="he">זֶה הַמֶּ֫לֶךְ</span> = this is the king (MS)
    
Mnemonic:

> Demonstrative Pronoun Perpetually Precedes, Perpetually dePrived of article

## Conclusion and Intro to Activities {-}

Your mission for the next two lessons is to focus on building your pronoun vocabulary.  You may notice more `Anki` words than usual to learn but most of these are short (and for next lesson, the pronouns will mostly be two letters each).  After you finish the stack in `Anki` we have two pronoun worksheets for you to test your memory.

It is important to know the gender, number, and where necessary the person of each.  Also the concept of multiple ways to say "you" can be confusing to the English speaker.  It's important to give the PGN, for example אַתֵּ֫נָה means "you (2FP)."

If you can picture yourself hiking the trails of Israel,  Lessons 8, 9, and 10 may represent some hills where you may need to push a little bit extra.  Then we'll get a bit of a breather with Lessons 11 and 12 before ramping up again with Verbs.  Keep at it!  You're doing awesome!

## `Worksheets`: Pronouns {-}

We have two worksheets for this lesson. Make sure you do the Anki work first, before tackling these worksheets.

While our focus is on reading Hebrew, pronouns are so prevalent that it's highly beneficial to commit them to memory.  Review the column on the right, then cover it up and try to complete the remaining columns by memory (right to left).

# Lexicon

<img src="images/lexicon.jpg" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> have created an abridged Lexicon to accompany this course.  This document is nice as vocabulary words are indexed to the Lesson #, and irregular plural forms and selected construct forms are also included.

[Open/download BBH Lexicon](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"}

You are also encouraged to check out the Lexicon resources in the [Holy Language Heritage Library](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}.  They are much more exhaustive.

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
