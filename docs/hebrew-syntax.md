# Hebrew Syntax {.Syntax}

> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to understand how words in our Bible work together to communicate meaning.  We call this "syntax".

This lesson serves as a bridge between the discussions on the Qal verb forms (Lessons 13-22) and the derived stems (Lessons 24-35).   

In a way, this could be the most exciting Lesson of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest because, here, you will begin to put all that information you learned over the past 22 lessons to work in better understanding how the Bible communicates to us.

In <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> the authors present around 30 different verses from the Hebrew Bible to illustrate how the language is used, often in an idiomatic or figurative sense.  With this knowledge, we can begin to think critically in our evaluation of differences in translation and the validity of arguments we read in commentaries. Much of this discussion in this lesson will introduce us to topics that will be discussed much more extensively in an intermediate Biblical Hebrew Course.

## Clause versus Sentence

* A clause has a subject and a predicate.
    * The simplest clause in Scripture is "Yeshua (subject) wept (predicate)"
* An _independent_ clause, such as "Yeshua wept" can be a complete sentence
* A sentence can have more than one clause
    * Now after the death of His servant Moses, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying, “Moses My servant is dead." (Joshua 1:1)
    * There are three clauses in the one sentence
* Hebrew will frequently start a clause with <span class="he">ו</span>
* We've used the terms "word-initial" and "word-final" throughout this course.  Now we will use "clause-initial" to reference the first word in a clause
* <span class="he">ו</span> is frequently clause-initial



## Word order

Normal Hebrew word order is Verb - Subject - Object.  We can abbreviate this V-S-O (of course in Hebrew, this goes from right-to-left).

* <span class="he">וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נֹחַ </span>  
    * _And God Remembered Noah (Gen 8:1)_
* <span class="he">וַיַּחֲלֹם יוֹסֵף חֲלוֹם</span>
    * _And (Then) Joseph dreamed a dream (Gen 37:5)_
* <span class="he">וַיִּקְרָא מֹשֶׁה אֶל־כָּל־יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>
    * _Then (and) Moses summoned all Israel (Ex 24:16)_

Since we say that V-S-O is the "normal" word order, whenever we encounter a clause that is **NOT** V-S-O we want to take note as to what is going on.  Below is an example of S-V-O used to emphasize the subject, Adonai.

* <span class="he">יְהוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד</span>
    * _Adonai shall reign forever and ever (Ex 15:18)_
    
 
Hebrew also can have O-V-S, particularly in poetry.   

::: {.box .light}
English standard word order is S-V-O, so this is the way we would translate regardless of the Hebrew word order.
:::

## Syntax of the Perfect conjugation

The Perfect _without_ the <span class="he">ו</span> consecutive is **NOT NORMALLY** the first word in a clause

* <span class="he">אַחַר הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה הָיָה דְבַר־יְהוָה אֶל־אַבְרָם</span>
    * _After these things the word of the LORD CAME to Abram (Gen 15:1)_
* <span class="he">וְהִנֵּה נָפְלוּ אֲבוֹתֵינוּ בֶּחָרֶב</span>
    * _For behold, our fathers FELL by the sword (2 Chr 29:9)_ 
* <span class="he">בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ</span>
    * _In the beginning, God CREATED the heavens and the earth (Gen 1:1_
    
However, the Perfect _WITH_ the <span class="he">ו</span> consecutive, is **ALWAYS** the first word in a clause

* <span class="he">וַיֹּאוְאָהַבְתָּ אֵת יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ</span>
    * _And you will love Adonai your God (Deut 6:5)_
* <span class="he">וְזָכַרְתִּי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי </span>
    * _And I will remember my covenant (Gen 9:15_

As we remember from Lesson 17, whenever we have the Perfect conjugation with the Vav, we translate it imperfectively.


## Syntax of the Imperfect conjugation

Similar to Perfect, the Imperfect _without_ the <span class="he">ו</span> consecutive is **NOT NORMALLY** the first word in a clause.  Below is an "S-V-O" verse we looked at earlier


* <span class="he">יְהוָה יִמְלֹךְ לְעֹלָם וָעֶד</span>
    * _Adonai shall reign forever and ever (Ex 15:18)_
    
The consecutive Imperfect is the first word in a clause.  This is the most common form in Hebrew narrative.

* <span class="he">וַיֹּאמֶר הַנָּחָשׁ אֶל־הָאִשָּׁה</span>
    * _The serpent said to the woman (Gen 3:4)_
    
The volitional imperfects (Cohortative and Jussive, without the Vav consecutive) are normally the first word in the clause.

* <span class="he">*נַעֲשֶׂה* אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ </span>
    * _Let us make man in our image_

::: {.box .info}
You already know how the verbs in each of these uses are formed because they all use the Imperfect paradigm.  The key to accurate translation is word order and whether or not there is the <span class="he">ו</span> consecutive prefix.
:::

## Volitional Clauses

Hebrew likes to link multiple verbs together. Word order can be a big clue in translating volitional clauses. 

* Multiple Imperatives (M+M) in succession:
    * <span class="he">*עֲלֵה* *וּקְבֹר* אֶת־אָבִיךָ</span>
    * _Go up and bury your father (Gen 50:6)_
    * This verse would be sequential - go up and (then you can) bury your father
    * Context may indicate a consequential translation - do this, **so that** you do that
* An Imperative followed by Perfect with Vav Consecutive (M + Pwc)
    * <span class="he">*לֵךְ* *וְאָמַרְתָּ* אֶל־עַבְדִּי</span>
    * _Go and say to my servant (2 Sam 7:5)_
    * The perfect verb acts as if it were a second imperative ("Go and say", not "go and you will say")
* Imperative followed by an Imperfect or Cohortative (M+I or M+C) to create a purpose or result. "So that..."
    * <span class="he"> רְדוּ־שָׁמָּה וְשִׁבְרוּ־לָנוּ מִשָּׁם *וְנִחְיֶה* </span>
    * _Go down there and buy grain for us from there so that we might live_

## Conditional Phrases

A conditional phrase is made up of two clauses.  You might want to think of this as an "if-then" statement.  The first gives the "if" condition, and the second states the "then" consequence if the condition is met<small>^[<small>The technical term for the first statement is the _protasis_, and the second statement is called the _apodosis_.</small>]</small> 

* <span class="he">וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלֶיהָ בָּרָק *אִם*־תֵּלְכִי עִמִּי *וְהָלָכְתִּי* *וְאִם*־לֹא תֵלְכִי עִמִּי לֹא אֵלֵךְ</span>
    * _Then Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, (then) I will not go." (Judg 4:8)_
    
::: {.box .info}
The Hebrew word <span class="he">אִם</span> is most frequently, but not always, used for the first clause.
The second clause often, but not always begins with <span class="he">וְ</span>
:::

## Disjunctive Vav

In this course, we have talked about the CONjunctive Vav.  This is a Vav that is prefixed to a verb and serves to link the narrative and move it forward in some fashion.

When a Vav is prefixed to a non-verb, it is called a DISjunctive Vav.  As the name implies, it indicate some kind of break or tangent in the narrative.  There are four major ways a disjunctive Vav is used as illustrated by the verses below.

* <span class="he">*וְהֵם* לֹא יָדְעוּ כִּי שֹׁמֵעַ יוֹסֵף כִּי הַמֵּלִיץ בֵּינֹתָם</span>
    * _(Now) They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them (Gen 42:23)_
    * Parenthetical use: <span class="he">וְהֵם</span>
    * A parenthetical comment to explain why Joseph's brothers believed they could speak freely
* <span class="he">וַיְהִי כְּהַיּוֹם הַזֶּה וַיָּבֹא הַבַּיְתָה לַעֲשׂוֹת מְלַאכְתּוֹ *וְאֵין* אִישׁ מֵאַנְשֵׁי הַבַּיִת שָׁם בַּבָּיִת</span>
    * _Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the household was there inside (Gen 39:11)_
    * Circumstantial use: <span class="he">וְאֵין</span>
    * A break in the narrative, in this case, to provide important information to set up the circumstances of the attempted seduction and subsequent imprisonment of Joseph
* <span class="he">וַיִּשַׁע יְהוָה אֶל־הֶבֶל וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ׃  *וְאֶל*־קַיִן וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ לֹא שָׁעָה</span>
    * _And Adonai had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard (Gen 4:4b-5a)_
    * Contrastive use: <span class="he">וְאֶל</span>
    * Often translated "but"
    * This contrasts Adonai's reponse to the two men's offerings
* <span class="he">וְהַנָּחָשׁ הָיָה עָרוּם מִכֹּל חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים</span>
    * _Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made (Gen 3:11)_
    * Introductory use: <span class="he">וְהַנָּחָשׁ</span>
    * A new theme or idea; sometimes an entirely new narrative
    * In this example, we move from the creation narrative to the temptation narrative

## Adverbs

* <span class="he">עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי־יְרֵא אֱלֹהִים אַתָּה</span>
    * _Now I know that you fear God (Gen 22:12)_
    * Adverb of Time: <span class="he">עַתָּה</span>
* <span class="he">וַיָּשֶׂם שָׁם אֶת־הָאָדָם אֲשֶׁר יָצָר</span>
    * _and there He placed the man whom He had formed (Gen 2:8)_
    * Adverb of Place: <span class="he">שָׁם</span>
* <span class="he">עֵינַי תָּמִיד אֶל־יְהוָה</span>
    * _My eyes are continually toward the LORD (Ps 25:15)_
    * Adverb of Degree: <span class="he">תָּמִיד</span>
* <span class="he">וַיָּבֹא אֲלֵיהֶם יְהוֹשֻׁעַ פִּתְאֹם</span>
    * _So Joshua came upon them suddenly (Josh 10:9)_
    * Adverb of Manner: <span class="he">פִּתְאֹם</span>

::: {.box .info}
* Adverbs are most frequently at the end of a clause.
* As the above examples illustrate, this is not a hard-and-fast-rule

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
