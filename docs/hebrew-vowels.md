> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must understand how words are formed and pronounced

Even though our goal may not necessarily be to converse in Biblical Hebrew, hearing the sound of the language aides our learning.  Vowels are what give a language its distinctive sound.  In Hebrew, the same three consonants can change meaning depending on the vowel combination.

As Izzy says in Hebrew Quest, “Vowels are important.”  On your screen, you see Genesis 1:9.  The black font shows the text with no vowels. Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red.  These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is _nikudot_. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses.  These marks also show where the word's accent is.<small>^[<small>Image Source: Originally uploaded as en:File:Example of biblical Hebrew trope.svg on 04:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC) by en:User:SyntaxError55. </small>]</small>

## Vowels that are not vowel letters {#vowels}

### Vowels come in three types: Long, Short, Reduced | Vowels come in five classes: A, E, I, O, U {-}

Like the Aleph-bet, we are going to have to commit the vowels in the table below to memory. You will do this in `Anki`. Knowing the vowel types and classes will make your grammatical life much more comfortable in the future.  

* The letter בּ is provided as a placeholder
* Say the vowel _after_ saying the associated consonant<small>^[<small>We will learn that Hebrew loves to break the rules.  In the next lesson, we will learn about an exception to the "vowel comes after" rule, called the *furtive patach*.</small>]</small> So the first vowel example is "baw" not "awb".
*  Future lessons will explain the difference between Qamets and Qamets Hatuf


```r
include_graphics("images/02.vowels_not_letters.png")
```

<img src="images/02.vowels_not_letters.png" width="500pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />



::: {.infobox .light}
Only **gutturals** take the "Hateph" vowels - to make it easier, we can pronounce all three Hateph vowels like the A in <u>A</u>muse

Hateph vowels are used because Gutturals reject vocal sheva (2.2)
:::


## Vocal and Silent Sheva {#sheva}

* Both are written as בְּ 
  * Both mark the END of a syllable
* VOCAL Sheva<small>^[<small>Many academic textbooks will use the term "Shewa" instead of "Sheva". Both words mean the same thing.</small>]</small> is a REDUCED vowel 
  *  Only non-gutturals can take a Vocal Sheva
      * Gutturals **reject** the Vocal Sheva and take the Hateph vowels instead
    * Pronounced like the A in <u>A</u>muse (same as Hateph Patach)
* SILENT Sheva is NOT A Vowel
    * <u>Any</u> letter can take a Silent Sheva
    * Silent/ No sound
    
::: {.infobox .info}
 We will learn how to distinguish between the two kinds of Sheva in the next lesson
:::

It is worth pointing out that in Hebrew Bibles you may come across a mark that looks like a super-sized sheva.  In English, we might say it looks like a colon (:).  In Hebrew this mark is called a sof pasuq and it is used to mark the end of the verse.  It is no other effect on grammar or pronunciation.  (סוֹף=end; פָּסוּק=verse).  And while we're on this note, sometimes you may see a vertical line |.  This has no meaning for us whatsoever.  You may ignore it when you encounter it.

## Vowel letters {#vowel_letters}

### Vowel letters use a consonant plus a nikkud to form a vowel {-}

Another table to memorize:


```r
include_graphics("images/02.vowels_letters.png")
```

<img src="images/02.vowels_letters.png" width="300pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

* Shureq is pronounced like Qibbuts (r<u>u</u>ler)
* Hireq Yod is pronounced like the i in mach<u>i</u>ne
* All others are pronounced like their non-vowel-letter counterparts
* Yod and Vav vowels - י,ו 
    * These are Long Vowels that do not reduce
    * Therefore they are called "irreducible (unchangeable) long vowels"<small>^[<small>We'll explain what this means in the next lesson</small>]</small>
    * These occur in the middle or at the end of a word

::: {.infobox .info}
If the Yod or Vav has a vowel of it's own, then the Yod/Vav is acting as a _consonant_, not an irreducible long vowel.
:::

* Hei Vowels - ה
    * Seghol Hei is a short vowel - the other Hei vowels are long
    * Hei vowels **ONLY** occur at the end of a word (often called "word-final hei")
    * Hei vowels are extremely common in Hebrew


## "Defective" and "plene" spelling {#defective_spelling}

In "defective" spelling, letter vowels can sometimes drop their letter and take on the corresponding non-letter vowel. The meaning of the word doesn’t change.

This is the word for "laws" showing both "plene" spelling (left) and "defective" spelling (right):


```r
knitr::include_graphics("images/defective.gif")
```

<img src="images/defective.gif" width="500pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

* Three vowel letters commonly take "defective" forms<small>^[<small>"Defective", in this sense, does not have a negative connotation.</small>]</small>
    * Holem-vav can drop the Vav and contract to Holem, as in the example above
    * Hireq-Yod can drop the Yod and contract to Hireq
    * Shuruq can drop the Vav and it's associated nikkud and contract to Qibbuts
    
The qamets-hei <span class="he">ה ָ  </span>sometimes drops the final ה, leaving just the qamets under the now-final letter.

::: {.infobox .info}    
As you progress, you’ll start to develop a mental checklist when you encounter something that does not seem to follow the normal/regular rules. Asking yourself “Could this be a defective spelling?” will be one of those checklist items.
:::

## The Daghesh Forte Doubles the Consonant {#daghesh_forte}

Notice the שּׁ in <span class="he">הַשָּׁמַיִם:</span>


```r
knitr::include_graphics("images/02.daghesh_forte.gif")
```

<img src="images/02.daghesh_forte.gif" width="500pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
 
* Since שׁ is not a בגד כפת letter, we know this *cannot* be a Daghesh Lene, but it is a Daghesh **Forte**
* The letter with the Daghesh Forte both ends one syllable and begins the next syllable
* If we were to syllabify <span class="he"> הַשָּׁמַיִם</span>, it would look something like the bottom line in the picture above (pronounce: `hash-sha-mayim`)<small>^[<small> `Mayim` is one syllable as we will learn in Lesson 3.  <span class="he">הַשָּׁמַיִם</span> means "the heavens."  From now on, we won't always provide a translation for every new word you encounter.  It's more important that you focus on the concepts.  You will have PLENTY of vocabulary work in Anki!</small>]</small>
* A similar word in English might be better = bet | ter
    * If we were to transliterate better into Hebrew hypothetically,  it might look like: בּטֶּר*<small>^[<small>The * means this is not a real Hebrew word, but we show it in this form for illustration.</small>]</small>
* Notice the syllable breaks in these words that have a Daghesh Forte:

```r
include_graphics("images/02.forte.png")
```

<img src="images/02.forte.png" width="200pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
* Any consonant (except for Gutturals and Resh) can take a Dagesh Forte, including a בגד כפת letter, which can take either a Daghesh Lene or a Daghesh Forte
    * The "Buck-up" letters will take the **hard** pronunciation regardless of a Daghesh Lene or Daghesh Forte - See the final word אַתָּה in the image above
    * "Any consonant" includes the Vav ו.  When a Vav has a Daghesh Forte it looks like this וּ. Does that remind you of anything?  Maybe something we just discussed on the previous page?
        * That's right. A Vav with a Daghesh Forte וּ is identical to a Shurek וּ.
        * It's surprisingly easy to tell the difference: if there is an additional vowel either under or over the same letter, or if the preceding consonant has a vowel, the letter is a Vav with Daghesh.  A Shurek will _never_ have an additional vowel following or preceding.

_Advanced tip:_ When you see a Daghesh Forte, it often means that another letter has disappeared<small>^[<small>Not entirely unlike the English apostrophe in words like _can't_.</small>]</small>.  We will talk more about this later in the course.

::: {.infobox .info}
It's good to think of the Daghesh Forte as the "Doubling Daghesh", since it doubles the consonant, and often changes a word's meaning.  

Conversely we can think of the Daghesh Lene as the "Meaningless Daghesh", since it does not ever change a word's meaning
:::


## Daghesh Forte Rule {#daghesh_forte_in_bgdkpt}

::: {.infobox .light} 
A Daghesh is a Forte if, and only if, it's preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva
:::

That's it.  That's the rule<small>^[<small>Strictly speaking, there are exceptions, but you won't encounter them in a first-year Hebrew course</small>]</small>.  

Quiz yourself with these examples (answers below):

* <span class="he">אַתָּה</span> = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>Yes, a patach. Daghesh Forte</small>]</small>
* <span class="he">בְּרֵאשִׁית</span> = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>No. Daghesh Lene</small>]</small>
* <span class="he">עַל־פְּנֵי</span> = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>No. Daghesh Lene.  The "hyphen" looking mark is called a Maqquef.  It has the same function as the Hyphen does in English.</small>]</small>
* <span class="he">מַבְדִּיל</span> = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>No, it is preceded by a Sheva. Daghesh Lene.</small>]</small>
* <span class="he">מִתַּחַת</span>  = Is the Daghesh preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva?<small>^[<small>Yes, a Hiriq. Daghesh Forte</small>]</small>


## Gutturals and Resh reject Daghesh Forte {#gutturals_reject_daghesh_forte}

* We said in Lesson One that the Gutturals don’t play nice with the other Hebrew Rules, and this rejection of the Daghesh Forte is one of those ways
* A Hebrew collision like this means something has to give. . . and the gutturals tend to get their way.
* It's like they have a force-field shielding them from other Hebrew grammar rules!


```r
knitr::include_graphics("images/02.reject.gif")
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/02.reject.gif" alt="That's no moon.  That's a Guttural!" width="600pt" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:unnamed-chunk-9)That's no moon.  That's a Guttural!</p>
</div>

* A large chunk of any Hebrew grammar course involves learning to resolve these guttural entanglements.
* You may see הּ. This dot is not a Daghesh but what is called a mappiq.  We'll talk more about the mappiq in Lesson 6.

## Lesson Conclusion and Activities {-}

Congratulations on completing the vowels lesson.  Make sure you know that Daghesh Forte rule and the guttural behavior  The Daghesh Forte is our Hebrew friend who can tell us a great deal about what is happening grammatically with a word.  

We're about halfway through the first stage of the course on Hebrew Grammar Foundations.  Keep going! You're doing great!  After you finish all of the activities for this lesson, you can claim the first of our `Twelve Tribes Badges`. 

Take a second to review the section headings 2.1 - 2.7 on the left side of the screen before heading on to tackle the activities.


### `Anki` {-}

* `Lesson 02 A.Vocab`
* `Lesson 02 B.Grammar`
* `Lesson 02 C.Verses`
  * Bible verses will arrive next Lesson
  * In this module, we will be learning common Hebrew names.
  * Sound out the words using your knowledge of Hebrew consonants and vowels.
  * As a general hint, with a couple of exceptions, the English names are pretty close to how they sound in Hebrew.
  
Access Anki using your mobile app, desktop version, or [the web-based version (login may be required)](https://ankiweb.net/decks/)


### `Vowel worksheet` {-}
* Practice writing the vowels using the [Vowel Writing worksheet/drill](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ETPKE3u-XGfpNdKmlIr3P_DRbkOOlcI_/view?usp=sharing){target="_blank"} See note<small>^[<small>ignore the "transliteration" column.  An answer key is on page two.  Repeat this worksheet until you can complete it correctly entirely from memory.</small>]</small>


## `Ruth Pursuit` {-}

### Your Quest: {-}

1. Identify the four UNCHANGEABLE LONG vowels that use YOD in Verse 1 (blue)<small>^[<small>In most word processors, you won't be able to isolate the vowel to highlight. Get as close as you can.</small>]</small>|
2. Identify the two UNCHANGEABLE LONG vowels that use VAV in Verse 1 (Green)
3. Identify QAMETS HEI in Verse 1.  There is a TSERE Hei between Verses 5-10.  Can you find it?<small>^[<small>The other vowels that use hei are less common, but we will see them when we discuss verbs.</small>]</small> (Purple)
4. Identify the three LONG vowels in Verse 1 (that are not part of a vowel letter) (pink)|
5. Identify three of the five SHORT vowels in Verse 1 (that are not part of a vowel letter)<small>^[<small>We haven't learned to spot Qamets Hatuf yet, and Qibbuts does not appear in this passage</small>]</small> (red)
6. Five the three REDUCED/HATEPHH vowels, including Hateph Qamets Hatuf<small>^[<small>You should be able to make out the word that has the Hateph Qamets Hatuph</small>]</small>.  They are in verses 2-4. (grey)
7. One of the more common verbs in the Tanach is **וַיֹּאמֶר **, which means "(and) he said. 
    * Vav-Patach-**Yod**-Daghesh Forte --וַיּ to start a verb means "And he (did or was something)  
    * If we change the second consonant from a Yod to a **Tav**, we get --וָתּ, "and **S**he (did or was something).  
            * Thus, וַתֹּאמֶר means "and she said."  
            * Challenge: Find the five instances of וַתֹּאמֶר in Ruth Chapter 1<small>^[<small>In at least three of the cases, you should be able to figure out who is speaking.</small>]</small>  (yellow)

# Lexicon

<img src="images/lexicon.jpg" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> have created an abridged Lexicon to accompany this course.  This document is nice as vocabulary words are indexed to the Lesson #, and irregular plural forms and selected construct forms are also included.

[Open/download BBH Lexicon](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"}

You are also encouraged to check out the Lexicon resources in the [Holy Language Heritage Library](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}.  They are much more exhaustive.

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
