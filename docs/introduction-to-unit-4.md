# Navigating this book {-}

In the upper-left corner of this page you will see a series of icons.  


```r
knitr::include_graphics("images/toolbar.png")
```

<img src="images/toolbar.png" width="300pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

These do the following tasks:

* the file drawer expands/collapses the sidebar table of contents; you can also click `s`
* the magnifying glass toggles search input; you can also click `f`
* the big `A` allows you to change the font size and theme
* the little `i` shows you available keyboard shortcuts


There are several ways to navigate from page to page within this guidebook:

* Use the left-navigation sidebar (type `s` to reveal/hide)
* Click the left or right arrow on each page to go forward or back
* Use the left or right arrow keys on your keyboard to move forward or back
* Use hyperlinks on selected pages, like this one: [Continue to Introduction section](#motivation)

# Get Help {- #get_help}

While this is a self-paced course with no formal instructor or teaching assistant, we do want to provide a way for you to get help if you get stuck.

We request that before you submit a question, you read through the lesson's Seven Points a couple of times, then attempt to do the Anki cards for that lesson.  If you are still unclear, we are here!

Use the form below to ask a question. Please note, we are staffed by volunteers, so please allow a few days for us to research and get back to you.  If you have general feedback or wish to report an issue, please use the [Report an Issue](#report_issue) form.

# (PART) Derived Binyanim {-}

# Introduction to Unit 4 {-}

Congratulations!  You now have the heaviest work of a first-year Hebrew grammar course behind you.  From here on out, we will be studying the six major derived Hebrew Verb stems: Niphal, Piel, Pual, Hiphil, Hophal and Hitpael.

The reason we spent so much time on the Qal stem is not only because it's the most frequently occurring stem, but everything from this point forward is based on what you learned in Unit 3.  This means, for the most part, the Lessons that follow will be shorter and much more methodical.

Summaries of each of the derived stems will consist of the overall diagnostic features.  It is THESE features that should be memorized, not the numerous paradigms.

## Lessons 24-35 {-}

Each stem will have two lessons:

* Lesson A - The "Strong" Verb paradigm
    * The meaning of the Stem
    * The spelling of the stem, including "Beginning Combinations" and $V_S$ formulas to help you "diagnose" the stem when you encounter it in the Bible
    * Complete forms of each conjugation using the קטל paradigm verb
        * The translation of the paradigm verb, while unfortunate and often awkward (for example "He will cause to kill") is truly incidental to our purposes  
        * It's more important that you are able to identify the vowels for any strong verb, regardless of $R_1$, $R_2$, or $R_3$.
        * The Perfect and Imperfect forms will have the Audio from Chapter 15 of _Hebrew Quest_, which will also be included in the Anki deck to help you with paradigm identification
    * Each lesson will have an OPTIONAL worksheet for you to practice the paradigm
        * As always, identification of patters is more important than memorization of paradigms
* Lesson B - Weak verb deviations
    * Spelling changes within caused by the behaviors of gutturals and other weak letters, Geminate verbs, Biconsonantal verbs, and other irregular verbs
* As you can see, we are taking a very mathematical approach with formulas and paradigms
    * Even if math wasn't your best subject in school, you should do fine with the rest of this course
    * The next couple of pages have some refreshers so you can get familiar with our nomenclature

## Review Vowel and Consonant Shorthand

* The following chapters will make extensive use of the "Vowel Shorthand" we discussed in the Unit 3 Introduction - be sure you are comfortable with this nomenclature
* $V_P$ is the vowel that is affixed to the verb's preformative, if there is one
* $R_1$ is root consonant #1 and $V_1$ is that consonant's vowel
* $R_2$ is root consonant #2 and $V_2$ is that consonant's vowel
* $R_3$ is root consonant #3 (we do not use $V_3$).
* $V_S$ is the "Stem Vowel", this is _usually_ $V_2$ 
    * If the first consonant is lost, $V_S$ is still the vowel with the second root consonant
        * In **שֵׁב***, $V_S = V_2 = \bar E$ - (Long E - Tsere)
    * For biconsonantal verbs, $V_S$ is between the consonants
        * In **קָם***, $V_S = \bar A$ (Long A - Qamets)
        * In **יַקוּם***, $V_S = \bar U$ (Long U - Shureq)

## Stem Vowel Pattern Nomenclature

* The derived stems tend to be much more consistent with their application of stem vowels
* We will use a code to memorize the stem vowels for non-Qal Strong verbs
* For example, the stem vowel code is 

$$V_{S_N} = A \sim \bar E (A)$$

* V_{S_N}$ means the <u>S</u>tem <u>V</u>owel for the <u>N</u>iphal. The final letter is the stem's parsing code.
* Everything to the LEFT of the tilde, $\sim$, is the PERFECT
* Everything to the RIGHT of the tilde is the IMPERFECT and related forms, Jussive, Cohortative, Imperative and Infinitive Construct
* Any exceptions are inside ()
    * Imperfect form exceptions apply to the Feminine Plural
        * Therefore $(A)$ in the formula means the Stem Vowel in the Imperfect FP, the Jussive FP and the Imperative FP is Short A - Patach
    * Perfect exceptions will tend to apply to the 2nd and 1st person forms
    * Niphal does not have any Perfect exceptions

knitr::include_graphics("images/23b.stemvowelformula.png")
```

<img src="images/23b.stemvowelformula.png" width="300pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


* Infinitive Absolute: $V_S = \bar E$ (Long E - Tsere)
    * Exceptions: Qal (Always) and Niphal (sometimes) use $\hat O$ (Holem Vav)
* Participle $V_S$ is P3MS, but lengthened if possible
    * For example, In the formula above, $V_{S_{NP}} = A$ for the Perfect.  Therefore, the Participle $V_{S_{NPt}} = \bar A$ (Long A - Qamets)

## Ruth Pursuit - Intermediate Hebrew {-}

# Lexicon

<img src="images/lexicon.jpg" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The authors of <u>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</u> have created an abridged Lexicon to accompany this course.  This document is nice as vocabulary words are indexed to the Lesson #, and irregular plural forms and selected construct forms are also included.

[Open/download BBH Lexicon](./images/BBH_Lexicon.pdf){target="_blank"}

You are also encouraged to check out the Lexicon resources in the [Holy Language Heritage Library](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}.  They are much more exhaustive.

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
