# Qal Perfect - Strong Verbs {.QP-s}



> To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to translate Qal verbs, which are over 2/3 of all verbs in the Bible

While our focus is not on writing Biblical Hebrew, you do need to be able to write the details on the Qal strong verb paradigm. This will make it easier to recognize Qal weak and non-Qal verbs.

## First Thought {-}

### <span class="he">לֹא־שָׁמְר֤וּ אֲבוֹתֵ֙ינוּ֙ אֶת־דְּבַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה </span> {-}

*Our fathers did not keep the word of Adonai (2 Chronicles 34:21)*

**שָׁמַר*** means guard or keep, in the sense of obey.  It is a verb that occurs frequently in the Hebrew Bible. In **לֹא־שָׁמְרוּ***, the word לֹא serves to negate the verb it preceedes.  Literally this might be "not they kept", but in English we would say "they did not keep".

Everyday, and frequently throughout each day, we have two choices.  We can keep His word or we can ignore His word.  Let us strive to have it be said of all of us, **שָׁמְרוּ אֶת־דְּבַר יְהוָה ***, "they KEPT the word of Adonai."

##  Qal is Simple action, Active voice

| |Active Voice| Passive Voice | Reflexive Voice
|:- |:- |:- |:-
Simple Action	| __QAL__ | Niphal | (Niphal)
Intensive	| Piel | Pual | Hitpael
Cause an Action	|Hiphil | Hophal

*  Remember this table is very high-level and perhaps over-simplified; but, it is a good starting place for understanding the meaning each stem
*  Qal is the primary Hebrew stem
*  The other six major stems are said to be "derived" from the Qal stem, hence the name "derived stems"

## Perfect is completed action or a state as a whole

* In translating, we will most often use the simple English past tense: she had studied
* Other appropriate translations depending on the context
    * Present perfect: she has studied
    * Past perfect: she had studied
    * Future perfect: she will have studied
        * In other words, saying "Perfect = past" and "Imperfect = future" is an oversimplification
* Stative verbs describe a state of being are also Perfect
    * English present is often a better translation: She is wise, she knows, she loves
    * English past might also be appropriate: she was wise
    * In a few sections, we will learn that in Hebrew, stative verbs are sometimes spelled differently
    
> The Hebrew perfect describes an action or a state of being as a whole, not as a process

* I.e. "she was studying" is an incomplete process, but "she had studied" is completed action

## Components of the Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm


```r
knitr::include_graphics("images/13.qptable.png")
```

<img src="images/13.qptable.png" width="700pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The next few sections go into detail of building the paradigm.  

## The Perfect Sufformatives

The table below shows the perfect sufformatives in the middle column.  The 1st and 2nd Person forms are similar to the respective pronominal suffix.


```r
knitr::include_graphics("images/13_perfect sufformatives.png")
```

<img src="images/13_perfect sufformatives.png" width="700pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Notes:

* 3MS has no Perfect sufformative
    * so the steps such as adding a sheva before a perfect sufformative" do not apply to 3ms
* Since 3mp and 3fp are the same, we simply say "3cp" - Third person, common, plural
* Good news: these sufformatives REMAIN THE SAME throughout all seven Perfect conjugations



## Qal Perfect Vowels

* $V_1$ is almost always Qamets
    * As we learned way back in this course, an unaccented long vowel in an open propretonic syllable, will undergo propretonic reduction
    * When this happens, you will see a Vocal Sheva, but you will be able to deduce that $V_1$ used to be a long vowel - and if it's a Qal verb, you'll know it used to be a Qamets
* $V_2$ prefers patach
    * In 3cp and 3fs, the Sheva of the perfect sufformative goes in $V_2$
    * Some stative verbs can also take a Tsere or Holem in $V_2$
    
## $V_S$ is accented in Finite verbs

* As we introduced in Lesson 12, verbs that have "person" designation are called Finite verbs
    * Perfect, Imperfect, Imperative, Cohortative, Jussive are FINITE
    * Infinitive Construct, Infinitive Absolute, Participle are NON-FINITE, because they do not have "person"
* The $V_S$ is accented in Finite verbs, when possible
    * As we said in the previous lesson, $V_S$ usually = $V_2$ - in <span class="he">קָטַל</span> $V_S$ = patach
        * If $R_2$ is a vowel letter, then $V_S$ = $V_1$ - in <span class="he">קוּם</span> $V_S$ =  shuruq
        * If $R_2$ disappears, then $V_S$ = $V_1$ - in <span class="he">קָם</span> $V_S$ = Qamets
* Exceptions where we accent after $V_S$:
    * $V_S$ is a Sheva or Hateph vowel - Sheva/reduced vowels _never_ take an accent
        * In the Perfect, we will see this in Qal Perfect 3fs and Qal Perfect 3cp
    * The verb has a "heavy sufformative"
        * A heavy sufformative pulls the accent
        * There are two heavy sufformatives in the Perfect
            * 2mp - תֶּ֫ם and 2fp - תֶּ֫ן
    * The verb has a pronominal suffix
    * $V_S$ is not one of the final two syllables


## A Sheva precedes a Finite Sufformative

The Sheva is rejected in the following circumstances:

* A Sheva does not replace an unchangeable long vowel
* A Sheva does not replace $V_1$ of the Qal Perfect (and only the Qal Perfect)
* When $R_3$ is <span class="he">א</span>, the א quiesces (generally resulting in Compensatory Lengthening of $V_2$)


If the sufformative has a בגדכפת letter (usually ת), that letter will take a Daghesh Lene



## Building the Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm

Our general philosophy is to prepare you to read Hebrew.  While it is unlikely you will ever need to "inflect קתל into the Qal Perfect 2fs", understanding how we build the paradigm will not only prepare you to identify verbs in the Bible, it will prepare you do spot when deviations occur.

Study the graphic and the steps below carefully.  It may seem confusing at first but, with practice, you'll get it.  You'll note that the steps work backwards from left to right


```r
knitr::include_graphics("images/13.Qal_Perfect_Strong.gif")
```

<img src="images/13.Qal_Perfect_Strong.gif" width="600pt" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

1. Add the perfect sufformatives (13.4)
2. Put a Sheva before the sufformative (13.7)
    * 3fs/3cp - the Sheva can't go under $R_3$ because $R_3$ already has a vowel
        * A consonant can't have more than one vowel
        * For these forms, the Sheva goes under $R_2$
3. Add Dagesh Lene to תּ that comes after any Sheva
    * all 2nd person forms and 1cs
4. $V_S$ is PATACH in the Qal Perfect Strong paradigm (13.5)
    * UNLESS $V_2$ is already a sheva from step two
5. Accent $V_S$ (unless there is one of the exceptions listed in 13.6)
6. $V_1$ is QAMETS (13.5)
    * 2mp/2fp - the Qamets is then reduced to a Vocal Sheva because of propretonic reduction
7. OPTIONAL - Add a metheg mark to $V_1$ 3fs/3cp 
    * The metheg can denote that the vowel is Qamets followed by a vocal Sheva and not Qamets Hatuf followed by a Silent Sheva
    * The Hebrew Bible does not do this
    
## Hearing the Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm

Below is the complete paradigm.  Be sure to listen to Izzy read the forms with the paradigm verb, קתל and take note of pronunciation and accents.

## Worksheets: Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm {-}

We are going to go a little out of order.  Normally, we save all of the activities for the end of the lesson, but here, we want you to pause and complete the [Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm](./images/13_qal_perfect_strong_paradigm.pdf){target="_blank"}.

> Complete the paradigm from memory at least once, then return here and continue in the guidebook.

We know you're tempted to keep on clicking to read the pages that follow.  Resist!

Doing the worksheet now will maximize your learning time - in other words, the material that follows in this lesson will make more sense to you if you have the paradigm in your short-term memory.

## Qal Perfect Strong Examples

* <span class="he">יָדַ֥ע</span>
    * No Preformative + No sufformative =  __P3ms__ 
    * $V_2$ = ַ◌  $V_1$ is ָ◌  = __QP__
        * $V_2$ can be ◌ָ  also
    * This is Qal Perfect 3MS (QP3ms) - he knows
    * As we said in the introduction to Unit 3, you will start to see the cantillation marks in words and passages.  If you don't recognize a mark as a vowel, it is a cantillation mark.
* <span class="he">שָׁמְר֤וּ</span>
    * Preformative? None | Sufformative? P3cp
    * $V_2$ is Sheva, but we know that the Perfect sufformative is preceded by a Sheva whenever possible.  In the P3cp and P3fs, the sheva of the sufformative displaces $V_2$.  If we know our vocab, we also know that the Lexical form is <span class="he">שָׁמַר</span>.   $V_1$ is Qamets.
        * As we will learn in Unit 4, when there are no other signs of a different stem we can default to Qal, since Qal is the most common
            * You will see this in your Anki exercises
            * As with <span class="he>זָכָ֑רְתְּ<span>, there are times where $V_2$ is Qamets instead of Patach - these are just spelling variants that occur over the many hundres of years the Tanach was written.  There is nothing otherwise to suggest that these are not Qal verbs
    * שָׁמְר֤וּ is Qal Perfect 3cp (QP3cp) - they guarded/observed


## Deviations from the Paradigm

* As we talked about in Lesson 12, what makes a verb "weak" versus "strong" is when one or more letters cause a deviation from the strong verb paradigm.  
* While the bulk of the discussion on weak verbs will be in Lesson 14, there are three weak forms we will introduce here.  
    * Words where $R_3$ = <span class="he">נ</span>, which we abbreviate as 3נ or sometimes III-נ
    * Words where $R_3$ = <span class="he">ת</span>, called 3ת or III-ת
    * Stative verbs where $V_2$ is not always Pathach
* Studying these now will demonstrate how you can use your knowledge of the Perfect Strong paradigm to determine the stem and conjugation of weak verbs. 

> In most cases, you already know the behaviors of "weak" letters!  

While "stative" verbs may be a new concept, we have already discussed the tendency of ת and נ to assimilate under certain circumstances.  This is exactly what is happening when we encounter 3ת and 3נ verbs.

## 3נ and 3ת Verbs

* We mentioned above how a Sheva will be placed before a Finite sufformative (if possible)
* When ת and נ have a Silent Sheva, each may assimilate depending on the letter that follows
    * In other words, the verb will lose $R_3$ and a Daghesh Forte will be placed into the first letter of the sufformative
    * An $R_3$ of ת with a Silent Sheva will only assimilate when the sufformative begins with ת
        * Not כָּרַ֫תְתָּ*<small>^[<small>Remember, the * means the Hebrew word is an impossibility, but is shown for illustrative purposes</small>]</small> but <span class="he">כָּרַ֫תָּ</span>
        * Not כְּרַתְתֶּם*, but <span class="he">כְּרַתֶּ֫ם</span>
        * IMPORTANT: Note how the Daghesh in the ת shifts from a Lene to a Forte (because the Daghesh is now preceded by a vowel that is not a Sheva)
            * This is your cue that something has changed, usually that a letter is missing
            * In theory, the root could be either כרן or כרת, but you already know כרת from your vocabulary work (and there is no verb root כרן)
    * An $R_3$ of נ with a Silent Sheva will tend to assimilate to either נ or ת
        * נַתַן is an extremely common 3נ verb meaning "to give"
        * Not נָתַ֫נְנוּ*, but <span class="he">נָתַ֫נּוּ</span>
        * Not נָתַ֫נְתָּ*, but <span class="he">נָתַ֫תָּ</span>
    
## Stative Verbs MAY have a different $V_S$

* Stative verbs describe a state of being, such as "wise", "old", or even "dead"
* The $V_S$ may change in some forms
    * There is what is called a "Patach Stative", that prefers $V_S$ of (wait for it...) Patach
        * Since Qal Perfect _already_ prefers a $V_S$ of Patach, there is no visible change
        * Patach Stative has a different $V_S$ in the Imperfect conjugiation
        * <span class="he">גָּדַ֫ל</span>, "he is great" is an example - this word maintains the Perfect Strong paradigm all the way through
    * Tsere Stative has $V_S$ of Tsere in the P3ms ONLY
        * <span class="he">כָּבֵ֫ד</span> = "he is honored"
        * All other PGN follow the Perfect Strong
    * Holem Stative has $V_S$ of Holem in P3ms, P2ms, and P1cp
        * Holem Statives are relatively rare and do not even appear in the Bible as P2fs or any of the plural forms other than P1cp
        * <span class="he">יַכֹ֫ל</span> = "he is able to"
        * <span class="he">קָטֹ֫נְתִּי</span> = "I am small"
            * Note the נְ DOES NOT assimilate - Hebrew likes to keep you guessing!
            * While we could ask, "Why didn't this assimilate?", this is not going to be very productive or satisfying in the long run. 
            * When you see only $R_1$ and $R_2$, and then a Daghesh Forte in the next consonant, it's better to ask "did $R_3$ assimilate?"

    * As we will learn next week, "weak" verbs are a lot more common than "strong" verbs
    * Even though we will formally study weak verbs in Lesson 14, you should be able to use your knowledge of $V_1$ and the Perfect preformatives, to determine the parsing solution
        * Of course, we've only studied the Qal Perfect!
        * When you encounter a "weak" verb, such as <span class="he">מָלְאָ֥ה</span>, which is 3א, or <span class="he">יָדָ֔עוּ</span>, which is 3עח (A ח or ע as $R_3$), try to see what changes occur (based on what you already know about Gutturals)

## Ruth Pursuit {-}        

###  Your Quest: {-}

1. Identify all Qal Perfect Strong Verbs (Yellow)

For now, you may consider a "strong" verb as one that does not have a guttural in any root consonant position.

In your attempt to identify only strong verbs, you may notice that there are many more Qal Perfect weak verbs than Qal Perfect strong verbs (you can highlight these for next time, we won't tell!).  This gives you an indication of the prevalence of weak verbs.

Hint: there are only four Qal Perfect forms that do not have a guttural.

1. BEFORE WATCHING THE VIDEO, read through the passage on your own straight through one time - pick up as much as you can
2. Now re-read the passage critically
    1. Highlight any words you do not know and look them up in a [lexicon](https://holylanguage.com/resources-dictionaries.php){target="_blank"}
    2. Sketch out a translation - there is a blank line between each verse
3. Now, using your marked-up copy of the passage, watch Izzy's _Hebrew Quest_ videos (video opens in a new tab)
    1. [Proverbs #1](https://holylanguage.com/proverbs-5.php){target="_blank"}
    1. [Proverbs #2](https://holylanguage.com/proverbs-6.php){target="_blank"}
    1. [Proverbs #3](https://holylanguage.com/proverbs-7.php){target="_blank"}
4. After the video, assess your translation.  How close was it?
5. How did the Ruach HaQodesh speak to you through the passage?

We do not include _Hebrew Quest_ study passage memorization work in the Hebrew Grammar Quest Anki deck.

# About the designer of this book {-}

* Chris Flanagan has been a member of HLI since 2013 and joined as a ministry volunteer in 2015.
* He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level.
* He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of "Hebrew Quest Memrise" and now "Hebrew Grammar Quest"
    * This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format
    * For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the "designer" or "compiler" of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the "author" of a static book
* Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years
* Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.  He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book)
