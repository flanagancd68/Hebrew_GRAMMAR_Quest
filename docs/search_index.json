Nouns consist of a person, place, thing, or idea and can be singular or plural. Hebrew also introduces the concept of gender. In this lesson we will review aspects of the Hebrew noun with specific attention focused on the rules of pluralization. Seven Practical Points for Lesson 4 Understand Noun Gender and Number Examine singular noun endings and endingless nouns for both Masculine and Feminine nouns Examine endings for plural and dual nouns Identify special dual forms Examine other/irregular Pluralization Describe the Rule of Sheva Define what is meant by Lexical Form Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts? Vowel and syllable preference The rules for Silent Sheva and Vocal Sheva Additionally, starting with this lesson we will invoke the shorthand weve been learning in Anki (e.g. MP = Masculine Plural, FS = Feminine singular). Parsing vs Inflecting: Many Hebrew grammar books expect students to know how to pluralize nouns in writing. This is called inflecting. Inflecting is when we take a base word and do something with it, such as change its gender or number. When those books get to verbs, they spend a lot of effort focused on taking a base verb and inflecting it into all the different forms (person, gender, number, active, passive, reflexive, and so forth). Parsing is somewhat of the opposite concept where you take an inflected word and break it down into its base form. Reading the Hebrew Bible does not require you to inflect a noun or a verb; however, reading the Bible does require you to parse a word. This is so that you are able identify the lexical form and understand what the word means means (or if you dont know what it means, how to look it up in a dictionary). Our objective with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is only that you know how to parse words. Beginning with this lesson you will see an Anki chapter called Workbook, which will have some activities like parsing. The ability to inflect IS a great skill to have to master the language. If you wish to dig deeper and get into inflecting, we encourage you to check out Basics of Biblical Hebrew or another suitable textbook or workbook.

When this occurs, most vocabulary lists will mark the word as (F). "],["noun-pluralization.html", "4.3 Plural and Dual Noun Endings", " 4.3 Plural and Dual Noun Endings For regular nouns, simply remove the singular ending if there is one, and add the plural ending. Plural endings: MP:   e.g.   becomes   becomes  (clouds)  becomes  FP:  e.g.  (queens)  becomes  Under the MP endings above, note the propretonic reduction when the original word is more the one syllable. As we saw in Lesson 3.2,  changes from  because an open propretonic syllable prefers a reduced vowel. A vowel under a non-Guttural will reduce to Vocal Shewa -  A vowel under a guttural will take a Hateph vowel, usually Hateph Patach -  An irreducible long vowel will not reduce -  Dual endings: MD:   e.g.  (two horses) FD:   e.g.,  (two hands) or   as in  (two laws).

For example you wont find  in a dictionary.

The Two syllable nouns where the accent is on the first syllable are classified as Segholate nouns. They get this name because frequently, though not always, there are two Seghol vowels.  (boy, youth) is a segholate noun even though it doesnt have any Seghol vowels. If a plural word has Vocal Sheva/Hateph under the first consonant and Qamets under the second, with the normal MP or FP ending, the word is likely a Segholate noun.  to   to   to  Geminate words take a Daghesh Forte Geminate (from the Latin for twins) words appear to have two visible letters (which we call biconsonantal), but at one point the second consonant appeared twice. Example  (people) was once *. The lexical form drops the extra consonant. When we pluralize a Geminate word, the twin letter reappears but as a Daghesh Forte instead of a consonant. So in our example,  becomes  (peoples). The reason we dont have a Daghesh Forte in  is that the last consonant of a word rejects the Daghesh Forte when it has no vowel. "],["rules-sheva.html", "4.6 Rule of Sheva", " 4.6 Rule of Sheva Sometimes, according to other rules of grammar, we end up with a scenario where we have two reduced vowels, such as two vocal sheva, back to back. However, an overarching facet of Hebrew is that two reduced vowels in a row cannot stand. The Rule of Sheva changes the first of two reduced vowels into the corresponding short vowel. The first of two contiguous Vocal Sheva will usually change to a Hireq. Note the unique situation when the second consonant is a Yod: library(knitr) include_graphics(&quot;images/04.vocal_vocal_hireq.png&quot;) These next two could be called Hateph copy-cat rules. Notice how the vowel under the first consonant in all six examples takes on the short-vowel equivalent of the hateph vowel: A hateph vowel under a Guttural that is followed by a Vocal Sheva will change to the short vowel in the same class (e.g. hateph patach to patach) library(knitr) include_graphics(&quot;images/04.hateph_vocal_shift.png&quot;) * A Vocal Sheva that is followed by a hateph vowel will change to the short-vowel in the same class as the hateph vowel. library(knitr) include_graphics(&quot;images/04.vocal_hateph_shift.png&quot;) When a prefix is added to . and the Tetragramaton the vowel changes are irregular: With  the aleph becomes quiescent after a prefix:  +  =  With the Tetragramaton, the prefixed letter with take a Patach, with nothing under the Yod:  To flip around the Rule of Sheva, suppose as you are reading, you encounter a syllable that begins with a short vowel followed by a reduced vowel. In that case, you may be looking at a grammatical scenario where there were originally been two reduced vowels. You may be wondering why you need to know this. Understanding that a syllable may have originally had a reduced vowel is an important clue when it comes to translating and parsing. If youre foggy now, hang in there. It will make sense in a bit!
