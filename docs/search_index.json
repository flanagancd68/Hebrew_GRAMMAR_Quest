Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x If you are familiar with our ministry, you know our flagship course Hebrew Quest, which introduces our students to Yeshua and our Jewish Bible. Hebrew Quest was designed to get students into the Hebrew text as quickly as possible, with minimal focus on learning rules. For many of our students, this approach is quite successful. We noticed that many other students started to drop off between lessons 12 and 16, after the Aleph-Bet lectures. For some students, these lessons were too much Hebrew grammar too fast, and for others, it was not enough Hebrew grammar. As a result, several of our students have asked us for a grammar resource to supplement Hebrew Quest. As we searched for a resource to recommend to these students, we noticed that they tended to fall into one of two camps: A workbook or a series of videos that are entirely self-paced/self-directed Academic/Seminary level textbooks and courses These two are often opposite extremes. Self-paced courses can have too little structure and often provide only a superficial review of Hebrew. In the end, the student may only be slightly more prepared to read the Hebrew Bible than if they had not done the course. There are also limited feedback opportunities as these courses are designed for independent learning. On the other hand, seminary courses and seminary-level textbooks are usually incredibly rigorous with copious amounts of reading, rote memorization of paradigms, lectures, and exams. Academic courses are fast-paced and high-stress.1 Seminary textbooks generally are much more detailed and advanced than most of our students need (or would enjoy)2 Additionally, with either option, our Holy Language students would incur additional fees to purchase these materials. Many of the resources we researched are top-notch. Depending on a students goals, we would not hesitate to recommend them. Its just that they were not quite what we were seeking for the majority of our students. See the next section to learn how Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is distinct. For example, in a seminary course, the 36 lessons in Basics of Biblical Hebrew are usually completed in 16 weeks. For example, there is usually an emphasis on writing Hebrew and conducting English-to-Hebrew translations. While these may be important skills to become fluent in Hebrew, one does not need these skills to read and understand the Bible, especially from a spiritual or devotional perspective.

Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Our Holy Language goals for a Hebrew grammar course are the following: Academically CHALLENGING, but with a LOW-STRESS level Primary emphasis on READING and UNDERSTANDING Gods Word We use grammar rules, paradigms, and memorization as a means to achieve this goal The final exam should be whether you can understand the Bible, not whether you can conjugate a a particular Hebrew verb We do not prioritize writing or speaking in Hebrew3 We are not addressing Modern Hebrew Self-paced for independent learning but with mechanisms to provide FEEDBACK, ENCOURAGEMENT, and ways to CELEBRATE Students ACCOMPLISHMENTS in the course Aligns with our Holy Language LEARNING PHILOSOPHY: emphasize active forms of learning over copious amounts of textbook reading and long lectures COMPLIMENTS and INTEGRATES WITH Hebrew Quest, but does not replace it; Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is not a substitute for completing Hebrew Quest SUSTAINABLE from a technical standpoint, meaning the course is inexpensive and straightforward for the ministry to develop, deliver, and maintain FREE of charge for our students Most importantly, the course must be YESHUA-CENTERED that approaches learning Hebrew grammar as a spiritual as well as an academic endeavor (which is also a big part of our Learning Philosophy) We are essentially trying to take the best attributes of a self-paced course and merge them with the best characteristics of a seminary-level Hebrew course! We believe that result is Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest! Holy Language Learning Philosophy We have talked a bit about our Holy Language Learning Philosophy. Our belief is you learn best by doing. Izzy discusses this in greater detail in the clip below from Hebrew Quest Lesson 1. As a reminder, you can increase the speed of YouTube videos by clicking Settings, then adjusting the Playback Speed to your liking. We believe this course, in conjunction with Hebrew Quest, would prepare a pastor or lay-teacher of a small-group, or traditional Christian or Messianic congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text in order to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience. Even so, we are not presenting this as a substitute for seminary-level Hebrew for those who are seeking (or whose vocational position requires) more of a formal instructional approach. With all this said, the more of THIS course and Hebrew Quest you complete, the more rewarding THAT course will be!. In any case, our prayer is that this course, along with Hebrew Quest, will give new life to Hebrew application in that persons teaching ministry. This books compiler can testify to this!

Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Weve said that Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest does not replace Hebrew Quest. Instead, we believe Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest supports and extends Hebrew Quest. In fact, one way to think of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest could be as Hebrew Quest: Extended Edition! Suppose you were to take a hypothetical microscope and inspect Lessons 13-15 of Hebrew Quest. These are the lessons where Izzy reviews Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, and other grammar topics. Under that microscope, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is what you would see. Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will start with a brief review of the Aleph-bet and the vowels we learned in Hebrew Quest Lessons 1-12 Then we begin our deep dive into core grammar topics touched upon in Hebrew Quest Lessons 13-15 Additionally, starting with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Lesson 12, students can elect to complete a Hebrew Quest Study Passage Track Primary geared for students who have not yet completed all of Hebrew Quest, this will incorporate the Proverbs study and the Bible reading sections from Hebrew Quest Students will read through the passage and compose a translation They will then watch Izzys Hebrew Quest teaching video explaining the passage Students who complete all of the Hebrew Quest Study Passage Tracks will receive extra special recognition upon completion of the course.

Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Emphatically NO! If you have finished Hebrew Quest, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest might be a logical next step to go deeper. On the other hand, maybe you started Hebrew Quest but hit some roadblocks. In that case, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest can provide you with important underlying grammatical concepts so, eventually, you can return to Hebrew Quest and finish up. Its important to know that Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is an extension of Hebrew Quest, not a substitute. As a best-case, we recommend you complete Hebrew Quest Lessons 1-12 before starting Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest. So, if you havent started either course, go ahead and start with the first part of Hebrew Quest. Hebrew Quest videos are here, and the accompanying Memrise module is here. To say it differently, Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest complement one another in a circular (and maybe slightly paradoxical!) form: The more Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, and . . . The more Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew Quest (especially Hebrew Quest Lessons 13-40) Either way, you cant go wrong! The most important thing is to start and ultimately complete both. Again, the Hebrew Quest study passage track within Hebrew Grammar Quest will get you on your way to this lofty goal of completing both courses. Lets get started! The next section on Anki and course setup will get your Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest outfitted properly.

This will present the card to you sooner (usually about 12 hours later) to make sure you really understand Similarly for Study Verses, if you got the correct answer for any other reason than you were able to read the verse in Hebrew (for example, you happen to have that verse memoried in English), select Hard Good All parts of the answer are correct; no hints For Bible Verses, mark Good when: you can read and understand the verse in Hebrew Your translation is roughly similar to the English answer, even if you need to take a few moments to work through the verse Your verb tense is correct (even though we wont study verbs until Unit 3) You do NOT need to have the passage and its meaning memorized to mark Good Be patient and honest with yourself. If you are unsure between Again and Good, then select Again. Easy We do not recommend selecting Easy. An exception might be when you are confident that you already have the word, rule, or passage memorized Be patient with yourself.

Workbook/Parsing Brief Hebrew word activities to reinforce the grammar concepts. In Unit 3, the focus shifts to what is called parsing of verbs. Verb parsing means identifying the root, stem, person, gender, number, and meaning of a verb. D. Study Verses You will begin to translate from Hebrew to English. This component may not be easy at first but stick with it! Although these verses are similar to the Hebrew Quest Memrise modules, our goal for the Study Verses is translation and comprehension, not rote memorization.

Top to bottom: proto-Canaanite (~1600 BCE), paleo-Hebrew (~900 BCE), Rashi (1500 CE), Ketav Stam (used in Torah scrolls and other formal documents), contemporary block, and modern cursive. This course will use the contemporary block style. In this initial lesson, we will meet the Hebrew Aleph-Bet. The letters are like a family. Like a family, there can be unique dynamics (including not always playing nice with each other!). This lesson will take a look at some of those dynamics. LESSON ITINERARY Meet the Hebrew Aleph-Bet Understand that Hebrew is written and read from RIGHT to LEFT Identify the group of five letters that have final/Sofit forms Identify the group of six letters that can take a Daghesh Lene Identify the group of four guttural letters that cause significant changes in spelling and punctuation (and the one additional letter that sometimes acts as a guttural) Identify the group of ten letters that sometimes behave differently in limited circumstances Differentiate among look-alike letters Note differences between Seminary and Sephardic pronunciation EQUIPMENT CHECK If you are eager to jump right in with Lesson 1, we understand. We are also excited for you to start! Equipment Check is where we will pause before each lesson to make sure you have the right tools and supplies in your backpack before heading on the next phase of your Quest. In future lessons, we will want to make sure you understand specific concepts before continuing.

The points below and on the following pages will provide some foundations. This way, your grammar journey gets started in the right direction. All letters you see in the picture of the Aleph-Bet above are classified as consonants. Whereas English has the vowel letters (A, E, I, O, U) as a core part of the Aleph-Bet, Hebrew treats vowels differently  and  are not vowels but silent consonants; in Sephardic pronunciation, they take on the pronunciation of their associated vowel (if there is one) Well talk about vowels in Lesson 2 Have you completed Hebrew Quest Lessons 1-11? If not, we encourage you to stop here and move over to Hebrew Quest to complete the Alephbet lessons.

Seminary pronunciation is in red above, while Sephardic pronunciation is in blue. Real-world Hebrew is based on Sephardic pronunciation21 Weve already talked about how only three of the Daghesh Lene letters need to BucK-uP With Seminary Hebrew, all six letters take on a soft pronunciation. The  without the Daghesh Lene receives something like the GH in aGHast. The  and  without the Daghesh Lene are closer to the English DH/TH like this Another difference between Sephardic and Seminary pronunciation is how to pronounce  In academia, the consonant receives the w sound and is called waw (pronounced like the English wow!) In most non-academic circles, it receives the v sound and is pronounced vav This is important because a lot of the resources that we will reference come from academia and thus will have the w pronunciation. For example instead of vav-imperfect, we will frequently see waw-imperfect There are also significant differences in pronouncing vowels, most notably the short a (a like apple; versus ah like father) For the most part, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will follow the Sephardic pronunciation Lastly, since we are talking about pronunciation differences, will use Adonai or the LORD when we encounter the Covenant Name22 Again, in some of the materials that we have leveraged from academic circles, you may see (or hear) the Covenant Name (Yah) written out as this is common in those settings We are taking a devotional approach \"Seminary Hebrew\" is a term borrowed from Dr. John Beckman. We dont say \"Seminary Hebrew\" to be disrespectful; we only mean to differentiate between the two pronunciation types. There is also what is called Ashkenazi pronunciation, which is beyond the scope of this course. It also has some different pronunciations. Most notably, the letter  is given an s sound at the end of a word, and O vowels are more prominent. So  (shabbat), would be pronounced Shabbos in Ashkenazi Please read Izzys statement on the Covenant Name: When I filmed Hebrew Quest I read Gods Hebrew name asYahweh. This is a relatively common practice in academic circles and was also an expression of my personal love for Gods holy name. Since then though Ive encountered conclusive evidence that Yeshua and his disciples followed the Jewish tradition of sayingAdonai\" instead of using the Sacred Name. Its my deep conviction that we should follow the example of Messiah and his apostles, so Ive returned to saying Adonai (Hebrew for the LORD) or HaShem (Hebrew for the Name) instead of using the Sacred Name, and I encourage our students to do likewise.\"  "],["activity-anki.html", "Activity: Anki", " Activity: Anki Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Congratulations on completing your first lesson!

Even though our goal may not necessarily be to converse in Biblical Hebrew, hearing the languages sound aids our learning. Vowels are what give a language its distinctive sound, and are what give words their meaning. Consider the simple English words bay, boy, and buy. These words have identical consonants but mean very different things because of the different vowels. It is the same with Hebrew. Above, you see Genesis 1:9. The black font shows the text with no vowels. This is how the Hebrew Bible was originally written. Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red. These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is nikudot which is the plural form of the word nikkud. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses. These marks also show where the words accent is.26 We will talk more about Cantillation marks in Unit 3.

Vowel letters commonly take defective forms31 Holem-Vav can drop the Vav and contract to Holem, as in the example above Hireq-Yod can drop the Yod and contract to Hireq Shuruq can drop entirely and contract to Qibbuts - this sometimes catches students by surprise - see caution box below. The Qamets-Hei   sometimes drops the final , leaving just the Qamets under the now-final letter. An unchangeable long vowel written defectively is still an unchangeable long vowel A Qibbuts that is not defective is a short vowel A Qibbuts that is a defective Shureq is an unchangeable long vowel For now, do not be concerned about the difference.

In addition to vowels, the ancient scribes and readers organically adopted a system of syllables and accents. They knew where one word ended and where the next began without needing to write it down. What we call Hebrew grammar is truly an exciting journey into the system of spoken and written Hebrew, which had its formation thousands of years ago!

If you find yourself getting frustrated, take a break, and come back to it later.

The good news is that once you get this lesson down, the ones that follow will be relatively straightforward.

Often, we need to employ the Rule of Sheva to help us identify the dictionary form of a word. Nouns consist of a person, place, thing, or idea and can be singular, dual or plural. Hebrew also introduces the concept of gender. This lesson will review aspects of the Hebrew noun with specific attention focused on pluralization rules. We will also learn the Rule of Sheva, which is responsible for the most common spelling variations in the Hebrew Bible LESSON ITINERARY Understand a Nouns gender and number Define what is meant by lexical form Examine singular noun endings and endingless nouns for both masculine and feminine nouns Examine endings for plural and dual nouns Identify special dual forms Examine other/irregular Pluralization Describe the Rule of Sheva EQUIPMENT CHECK Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

We will use the paradigm word  to illustrate WHY WOULD WE NEED TO INFLECT? Technically we dont; we will never be asked in reading the Hebrew Bible to take a MS adjective and inflect it into the FP We DO need to be able to identify the gender and number of an adjective based on its ending We MAY also need to identify the lexical form of an unfamiliar adjective when it has an ending and the vowels have changed For these reasons, learning adjectival inflection is beneficial An adjective is either masculine or feminine An adjective is either singular or plural (dual nouns take plural adjectives) An adjective will match the gender and number of the noun that it modifies or for which it substitutes This is a big difference from nouns, which can change number but never gender Note that for irregular nouns, the adjective will not necessarily match the exact ending   - even though  has the irregular -im ending, the adjective  remains the regular feminine plural An adjective will use expected gender and number endings as shown in the graphic above The Lexical Form of an adjective is the MS The MS form is usually endingless The MS can be Seghol+Hei as in , which is MS for pleasing, beautiful. Note that unlike , most adjectives undergo vowel changes when the inflectional endings are added. The good news is you already know what to do. Adjectives follow the same rules as nouns.

The main challenge with a pronoun is determining the noun it replaces. See what happened there? We used the pronoun it. You probably deduced it was referring to the word pronoun, not noun. That is because you are very familiar with English context and syntax. The example, John saw Bob. He said, hello is ambiguous; we are not sure what the author meant to convey The example John saw Sally. He said, hello is not ambiguous at all Hebrew works very similarly As such, this is an important topic that will take two lessons (8 and 9).

In Lesson 6, we learned about one-letter preposition prefixes to words. Pronominal suffixes work similarly. The difference is these go on the back of words instead of the front. On a noun, a pronominal suffix indicates the one who owns or is related to the noun: His books / her houses / their house / our father As this indicates a specific noun (in other words, not just any books, but HIS books), a noun with a pronominal suffix is DEFINITE This is our third of four factors that make a Hebrew noun definite79: Has the (definite) article Is a proper name Has a pronominal suffix On a preposition, the suffix indicates the object: to her / with them / behind him / in front of it Verbs also take pronominal suffixes, which will indicate the verbs object. We will study these in Lesson 19. Pronominal suffixes have gender, number, and person. Independent personal pronouns were always subject pronouns (e.g., I, she, he, it, and they) Pronominal suffixes are always object or possessive pronouns (e.g., me, my, her, him, them, theirs) You can be an ambiguous term in English, not only with number and gender but also, you can be either a subject or object Hebrew has distinct ways of saying 2MS, 2FS, 2MP, and 2FP, as well as different forms for subject and object We will meet #4 in Lesson 10 "],["9-4-type-1-and-type-2-suffixes.html", "9.4 Type 1 and Type 2 Suffixes", " 9.4 Type 1 and Type 2 Suffixes Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Hebrew has two distinct groups of Pronominal suffixes Type 1 suffixes go on SINGULAR nouns80 Keep in mind there are both plural and singular Type 1 suffixes for use on singular nouns Multiple people can have ownership of a single object In English, we would say his house and their house Type 2 suffixes go on PLURAL nouns Similar to above, there are both singular and plural type 2 suffixes for use on plural nouns his houses as well as their houses The type of suffix on a preposition means nothing in terms of translation; each preposition will only take one class or the other As with most grammar rules, there are exceptions.

Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x A construct chain consists of at least two nouns linked together. The first important thing to know about a Hebrew construct chain is this: The very last noun in the chain is said to be in the absolute state. All words in the chain before the absolute noun are said to be in construct state. Back to  , house of bread bread would be in the absolute state house of is in the construct state The entire phrase would be called a construct chain A construct chain has one and only one absolute noun and one or more construct nouns The purpose of the chain is to describe the first noun in the chain. It might be reasonable to think that the chain would be describing the noun in the absolute state, but that is not the case In  , we are describing the house, not the bread A chain describes the first (true) NOUN in the chain, not necessarily the first word in the chain, which may be an adjective acting as a noun If there were a substantival adjective as the first word, e.g., wise of heart, the chain is describing heart, not wise In English, we would typically add the word of after each word in the construct state. We could say the kings son or the son of the king, and both would mean the same thing Translating a construct word as of is a starting point and not a hard-and-fast requirement Just like we may add 's, Hebrew has different spelling for nouns in construct The absolute noun is the normal spelling and meaning "],["10-2-what-makes-a-construct-chain-different.html", "10.2 What makes a construct chain different?", " 10.2 What makes a construct chain different?

A word is definite if it: Has the article -  Has a pronominal suffix -  Is a proper noun -  Is in a construct chain where the last, absolute, word is definite -   = THE son of the king Even though a noun in construct may not have the definite article, it is deemed definite when the last word (the absolute noun) is definite.

You already know your vowels, so dont let these marks trick you! Trying to read with these marks can be visually distracting and overwhelming at first. With practice, you will get used to them.

Qal verbs represent simple action, or active voice with a simple unnuanced type of action.90 Our quest is to translate accurately.

Moses, Elijah, John the Immerser, and several others all had their time in the Wilderness that God used to mold them as servant-leaders. Of course, we can point to Yeshua himself and his time in the wilderness at the beginning of his ministry. Embrace the wilderness! Figure 12.1: Acacia tree in Red Canyon.

Note how the main narrative does not continue but pauses to let us know the names of the people involved. This is providing supplemental background information. The Conjunctive Vav in Ruth 1:7 serves to begin a more detailed, focused narrative account of Naomis return Note how the Disjunctive Vav in the final clause of 1:14 - Vav + non-verb (subject) + predicate - introduces a CONTRAST of Ruths attitude of clinging, signaling deep loyalty and attachment to Naomi (see the  +  note in Lesson 13 answer key), compared to Orpahs goodbye kiss In 1:16,  introduces a subordinate clause that has an explanatory function. Ruth tells Naomi to stop urging her to go back because she has determined that she will follow Naomi wherever her mother-in-law goes.107 1:17 has what some scholars refer to as an oath formula.  gives the punishment for breaking the promise, and  gives the condition. The specifics appear to be implied rather than stated. This makes a literal translation awkward. At the same time, any other translation becomes somewhat speculative and dependent on what the translator believes is the context. NET renders the first clause as The LORD will punish me severely. Other oaths of this type appear in 1 Samuel 14:44, 1 Samuel 20:13, 2 Samuel 3:9, 1 Kings 2:23, and 1 Kings 19:2 In 1:20,  introduces a subordinate clause that has an explanatory function. Naomi is elaborating on why she wants a new name. We have noted that most Hebrew clauses begin with a verb, but 1:21 begins with I. Naomi is drawing attention to her condition: full when she left, but now returning empty. Curiously, Ruth evidently counts for nothing. Naomis attitude will definitely change by the end of the book! Also, note in 1:21 the Disjunctive Vav clauses, And Adonai followed by And Shaddai. Chisholm notes that the use may be semi-poetic: Adonai has testified about me; Shaddai has afflicted me108.
