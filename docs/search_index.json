Listen to a lecture, read a chapter, take a test, and youll learn Hebrew. We wish it were that simple. Hebrew, the Holy Language Way, requires active participation. Thats where our Holy Language Learning Philosophy comes in. "],["our-learning-philosophy-active-engagement.html", "Our Learning Philosophy = ACTIVE Engagement", " Our Learning Philosophy = ACTIVE Engagement Learning Hebrew the Holy Language Way is designed not just to feed you fish but also to teach you to fish1. When someone provides you fish, you are only passively receiving. When you learn to fish, you are active and intentional. In other words, we believe you will learn best when you actively (and dare we say passionately) engage with the Holy Scriptures. If done this way, learning Hebrew will not merely be another academic course you take, but it can be a life-changing experience. With the addition of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, Holy Language Institute offers yet another way for you to embrace Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah. Refer to Hebrew Quest, Lesson 1. "],["relationship-to-hebrew-quest.html", "Relationship to Hebrew Quest", " Relationship to Hebrew Quest Hebrew Quest took you directly to the Hebrew Scriptures. It brought you in touch with the Hebraic side of the Bible that, perhaps, you had never experienced before. We introduced you to a different aspect of what you may have known as the Old Testament. Maybe before Hebrew Quest, you had kept this Old Testament at a safe distance. Now, you may have a new appreciation. Perhaps you are building a closer friendship with what you now know as the Tanach or the Hebrew Scriptures. Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to take you to the next stage of that friendship. It takes you inside the Hebrew Scriptures. Maybe its like progressing from a good friend to an intimate friend. A friend who is always there for you. A friend who offers you consistently reliable wisdom and counsel. Such a friendship can be challenging and even difficult at times2. Maybe when such a friend tells it like it is, you dont always like to hear it. But deep down, you know this type of friendship is one of the most rewarding relationships you can have this side of heaven. Whether or not you have finished (or even started) Hebrew Quest, we believe you will find Hebrew GRAMMAR quest a fruitful and life-changing experience. See Appendix Q&amp;A for a broader discussion on how Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest work together. see Philippians 2:12 "],["three-stages-of-preparation.html", "Three Stages of Preparation", " Three Stages of Preparation According to Dr. Wayne Stiles, to get the most out of a tour to Israel, one must actively undergo three stages of preparation3: Practical Preparation Physical Preparation Spiritual Preparation We believe these exact principles apply when learning Hebrew the Holy Language way! We have built this course around these same three concepts. Whether you have been to Israel or not, we believe this will make sense. Read on for an explanation. Stiles, Wayne.

"],["practical-preparation.html", "Practical Preparation", " Practical Preparation Before a big trip to Israel, you need to know some basics. For example, you need some essential Holy Land geography and Biblical relevance. This way, you wont be completely lost when you arrive at a specific site, say Capernaum or Mount Carmel. You need to know why these places have meaning and are worth your time. You might call this getting the lay of the land. Primarily, what this Guidebook consists of, is giving you the lay of the Hebrew Grammar land Just like a tour guide might give you a few pointers on a site to fully experience it, we will provide you with the essential things you will need to know about each lesson. We call these the seven practical points. Our goal is to keep this discussion at a high-level. Other textbooks and lectures might spend time explaining concepts to you in great detail. We will not. Our goal is to give you just enough to get you pointed in the right direction. What youre reading right now is not just another grammar textbook. It is your Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Guidebook packed with useful information and hands-on activities. But dont feel that weve let you fend for yourself like a tourist in a Jerusalem traffic jam! We have a workout plan to get you into Hebrew Health, and we have established checks to make sure you have all the right equipment in your pack before you continue in your quest. Equipment Check Each Lesson of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest builds upon the previous one. At the beginning of each chapter, you will see an Israeli stop sign with a few questions. Use this as an opportunity to check whether you are familiar enough with the major concepts (and memorization where needed) from the previous lesson before you move on with your journey. We call this Equipment Check. Here, we leave the decision to proceed with your quest up to you. Be honest with yourself. If you are unsure about any area, we strongly encourage you to return to Anki for some more review. "],["physical-preparation.html", "Physical Preparation", " Physical Preparation Strength: Get Hebrew healthy with Anki Aerobics Israel is a rocky, hilly place. Many of the best sites require a walk or even a small hike from the parking lot. Those who hope to see the country from a bus window but who could have done more had they done some exercising beforehand are going to miss out on the best parts. For maximum benefit, travelers must be ready for a lot of walking. In Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, we want to emphasize active, not passive, learning. So we call our learning exercises ACTIVities. The way we think of it, another function of this Guidebook is to be your personal trainer. A trainer shows you how to do your workout safely and effectively. He or she gives you some practical pointers and then turns it over to you to do the actual strength and endurance training. In our case, your brain will be doing the lifting instead of your biceps. You will spend the majority of your learning time in a free flashcard program called Anki. Anki is the equivalent of your gym and cardio equipment for Hebrew Health Just like working out is not easy and you dont always see quick results, Anki will not always be quick and easy. Just like physical exercise, if you stick with it, you will see the rewards over time In addition to Anki, some lessons will have worksheets to reinforce concepts Download the Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest (Preview Version) Anki Deck See Anki discussion in the appendix for additional information on Anki, including installation and settings Endurance: Combat the fog (aka grammar jet lag) For most of us, Israel is close to halfway around the globe away from home. After such a long flight, we are unlikely to avoid jet lag entirely. We can take steps to minimize the effects and work through it as quickly as possible. Jet lag is similar to a phenomenon we can encounter when studying a new language. Dr. Bill Mounce calls \"the fog. It may take a lesson or two (or longer) for some concepts to make sense and the fog to lift. In addition to a steady flow of new material, Anki has an algorithm to deliver structured reviews to help you keep working through your grammar jet lag Periodically, there will be Quest Quizzes to assess your progress Are you OK to continue? Do you need to review some more before going on? If you do, thats perfectly OK; Its all part of working through the fog. The quizzes are scored for your assessment, but no grades are recorded - "],["spiritual-preparation.html", "Spiritual Preparation", " Spiritual Preparation Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is a spiritual journey! A trip to Israel is not like any other vacation - its a spiritual journey. Unfortunately, all some do is see some cool sites and take some pictures. Imagine going all that way only to miss a tremendous opportunity to meet Yeshua in His extraordinary Land. Similarly, suppose we view learning grammar as strictly an academic effort. We would risk missing insights Yeshua might want to teach us. We have three aspects of being spiritually intentional in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest: prayer, scripture reading, and encouragement. Prayer (Philippians 4:6-74) We want to begin each lesson with prayer Each lesson will start with a suggested prayer topic You can focus on this, or maybe something else that is on your heart Pray and be open to what Yeshua may be teaching you Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16-175) Ruth Pursuits - learning grammar concepts while learning Ruth 1, the beautiful passage of Scripture where a gentile bride commits herself to serve the God of Israel Anki Study Verses You will read and begin to translate passages in Anki Youll also listen to the audio by Izzy to begin to hear the sound of the language There are over 400 study verses! Encouragement (1 Thessalonians 5:116) Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is not a quick sprint - as weve been saying, its a long journey for which you will need intense training - it will be critical to stay encouraged to finish the quest! Twelve Tribes Badges7 Each of the Twelve Tribes has an emblem or symbol that has traditionally be associated with that tribe Taken in total, all Twelve Tribes can teach us different aspects of our relationships with God and our neighbors After two or three lessons, you will have the ability to unlock a new badge and learn more about what that tribe represents for us We will ask you to confirm that you have completed all listed ACTIVities up to that point. Once you do this, you will receive your badge! Graduation Process8 For Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, there will be a Graduation Process, similar to what we have for Hebrew Quest At the end of each unit, you will be eligible for a certificate of completion When you finish the entire course, well send you a printable diploma and your choice of a clay lamp or Hebrew letters mug9 View each ACTIVity as an act of worship! Philippians 4:6-7 (NASB) Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in Yeshua our Messiah. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (NASB) All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17 so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. 1 Thessalonians 5:11 (NASB) Therefore, encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.

Just the opposite: you will not want to move on to lesson 2 until you have the Aleph-bet memorized. We believe learning is best accomplished when you are learning and challenging (and maybe struggling a bit) yourself. We are just here to give you some pointers, so your journey gets started in the right direction. Notes: All letters you see in the picture of the Aleph-Bet above are classified as consonants. Whereas English has the vowel letters (A, E, I, O, U) as a core part of the Aleph-Bet, Hebrew treats vowels differently  and  are not vowels but silent consonants; in Sephardic pronunciation, they take on the pronunciation of their associated vowel (if there is one) Well talk about vowels in the next lesson This would be a great time to review the Letter lessons in Hebrew Quest Practical teaching on how to write the letter Spiritual insights - what the letter teaches us "],["one-2.html", "1.2 Hebrew is written and read from RIGHT-to-LEFT", " 1.2 Hebrew is written and read from RIGHT-to-LEFT Note the front of a Hebrew book is in the same location as the back of an English one: To our western eyes, this looks backward (but Israelis would say we are reading backward!)

Real-world Hebrew is based on Sephardic pronunciation17 Weve already talked about how only three of the Daghesh Lene letters need to buck up18 Another difference between Sephardic and Seminary pronunciation is how to pronounce  In academia, the consonant receives the w sound and is called Waw. In most non-academic circles, it receives the v sound and is pronounced vav. There are also significant differences in pronouncing vowels, which we will talk about in Lesson 2. For the most part, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will follow the Sephardic pronunciation Some terms like Waw consective and wayyiqtol are prevalent in the field of Hebrew Grammar, including modern Bible software (see image). This Guidebook and course will use Adonai or the LORD when we encounter the Tetragramaton19. Seminary Hebrew is a term borrowed from Dr. John Beckman. We dont say Seminary Hebrew to be disrespectful; we only mean to differentiate between the two pronunciation types. With Seminary Hebrew, the  without the Daghesh Lene receives something like the GH in aGHast. The  and  without the Daghesh Lene are closer to the English TH like this.  Pronouncing/writing/transliterating the Holy Name of God tends to be much more common in Christian academic circles. If you were to read Basics of Biblical Hebrew, you would see the name Yw-h frequently. We do know of academians, such as Dr. John Beckman and Dr. Robert Cargill, who will use the circumlocution of respect instead of pronouncing the name (and request their students do the same), so this is not a hard and fast academic distinction "],["activity-letter-writing.html", "ACTIVity: Letter Writing", " ACTIVity: Letter Writing Practice writing the letters individually using the Letter Writing worksheet Practice writing the entire AlephBet until you can do it five times from memory.

(wikipedia link) As Izzy says in Hebrew Quest, Vowels are important. On your screen, you see Genesis 1:9. The black font shows the text with no vowels. Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red. These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is nikudot. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses.

In addition to vowels, the ancient scribes and readers organically adopted a system of syllables and accents. They knew where one word ended, and another began without needing to write it down. What we call Hebrew grammar is truly an exciting journey into the system of spoken and written Hebrew, which had its formation thousands of years ago! The Tel Dan Stele was a significant archaeological find of the late 20th century. Written in Aramaic, closely related to Hebrew, the carving dates to the 9th Century BCE. It is notable for containing a reference to the house of David. It is the earliest known extra-biblical reference to King David. Before its discovery, many scholars had cast doubt on whether David existed. Archeologists discovered it at Dan near the Lebanon border in modern Israel.

We believe this course, in conjunction with Hebrew Quest, would prepare a pastor or teacher of a traditional Christian congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text to be able to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience Additionally, for those who have had first-year Hebrew at seminary (perhaps many years ago) but have struggled to apply knowledge of the original language to their vocation, or for those pastors/teachers who may have never taken a grammar course in Hebrew, our prayer is that this course, along with Hebrew Quest, will give new life to Hebrew application in that persons teaching ministry57 There are speaking activities beginning with Lesson 3, but this is more to engage additional senses in the learning process and not to become a fluent reader. This books author can testify to this! "],["about-holy-language-institute.html", "About Holy Language Institute", " About Holy Language Institute Jesus is Jewish.
