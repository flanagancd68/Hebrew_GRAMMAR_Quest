If you are familiar with our ministry, you know our flagship course Hebrew Quest, which introduces our students (who frequently have a background of traditional Christianity) to the Jewishness of our Messiah and of our Bible. Hebrew Quest was designed to get students into the Hebrew text as quickly as possible, almost by immersion. There was not focus on learning rules. For many of our students, this approach was very successful. We started noticing that other students began to drop off between lessons 12 and 162. The feedback we received was many students were getting stuck on grammar. As we searched for Biblical Hebrew grammar resources to recommend to our students, we noticed that they tended to fall into one of two camps: A workbook or a series of videos that are completely self-paced/self-directed. There may be a some exercises, but in general, is not very rigorous from an academic standpoint and there is no feedback on a students progress. Academic/Seminary level textbooks or courses. These are extremely rigorous with copious amounts of reading, lectures and exams. The pace of these courses is usually fast and the stress is high. There is a large focus on due dates and grades. Although many of these resources are top-notch, here is what *we wanted to see in a grammar course: In terms of rigor, not necessarily easy, but also enjoyable and low-stress Self-paced and independent, but provides feedback and encouragement Aligns with our Holy Language Learning Philosophy: a course that emphasizes active forms of learning more than tons of reading and long lectures Technologically simple and inexpensive to develop, deliver, and maintain, easy for our students to use, but also high-quality and visually pleasant Most importantly, Yeshua-centered that approaches learning Hebrew as a spiritual as well as academic endeavor We couldnt find a course like thisso we BUILT one!

In most non-academic circles, it receives the v sound and is pronounced vav. There are also significant differences in pronouncing vowels, which we will talk about in Lesson 2. For the most part, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will follow the Sephardic pronunciation Some terms like Waw consective and wayyiqtol are prevalent in the field of Hebrew Grammar, including modern Bible software (see image).

Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red. These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition.

In addition to vowels, the ancient scribes and readers organically adopted a system of syllables and accents. They knew where one word ended, and another began without needing to write it down. What we call Hebrew grammar is truly an exciting journey into the system of spoken and written Hebrew, which had its formation thousands of years ago! The Tel Dan Stele was a significant archaeological find of the late 20th century. Written in Aramaic, closely related to Hebrew, the carving dates to the 9th Century BCE. It is notable for containing a reference to the house of David. It is the earliest known extra-biblical reference to King David. Before its discovery, many scholars had cast doubt on whether David existed. Archeologists discovered it at Dan near the Lebanon border in modern Israel.

Emphatically - No! This grammar course starts from the beginning (with learning the Aleph-bet) and assumes no prior knowledge of Hebrew With that said, the more of Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more comfortable you may find it is to work through the grammar material If we were to categorize as good, better, best in terms of Hebrew Quest completion, heres what we would say: Good: You have completed some or no Hebrew Quest lessons This means that the first three lessons of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest might take you a little longer, but once you have that foundation, youll be up to speed Better: You have completed through Hebrew Quest Lesson 12 (the Aleph-bet and Vowels) This means the first three lessons will go a little more quickly for you Best: You have completed through Lesson 15 (verbs) and beyond This means that more of the concepts presented in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will tend to be things you have heard before versus brand new "],["when-i-complete-this-course-should-i-go-back-and-finish-hebrew-quest.html", "When I complete this course, should I go back and finish Hebrew Quest?", " When I complete this course, should I go back and finish Hebrew Quest? ABSOLUTELY! In fact, the most logical next step after completing a first-year Hebrew grammar course is to dig into the Scriptures and start reading Hebrew Quest, starting with Lesson 16, is all about reading Hebrew60 To say it differently, Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest complement one another in a circular (and maybe slightly paradoxical!) form: The more Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, and The more Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew Quest Either way, you cant go wrong! Although, with your more in-depth knowledge, you may be able to go a little faster. If the Hebrew Quest videos are too slow for you, click the Settings gear icon in the bottom right corner of the video, click Speed, and then select a faster speed.

Which one are you more interested in? Its more important to pick one, jump in, and start learning Hebrew. * If the word grammar makes your stomach churn, then start with Hebrew Quest. * If you feel like you might want to build of a traditional foundation, then start with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest. * For a blend, we recommend you do the first 11 lessons of Hebrew Quest to learn the Aleph-Bet, and then come over to Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.

Heres a sequence we might recommend: Do the first 11 lessons of Hebrew Quest - this will take you in-depth through the Aleph-bet, not just academically but spiritually. After you learn the Aleph-bet, give Hebrew Quest Lessons 12-15 a try. If the grammar pieces are clicking, then definitely go on to lesson 16 and the study passages. You always have the option starting this course at anytime. Conversely, weve found that a lot of folks get stuck on these lessons If this is you, then know youre one of the reasons we designed this grammar course. You might want to pause Hebrew Quest, and immediately jump into Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Whichever direction you take, we would encourage you to ultimately complete both Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.

As we say above, we want students to learn by doing While Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will cover the same concepts as a typical first-year Hebrew textbook, the instructional design team at Holy Language Institute are big proponents of active learning as opposed to passive learning Reading a book is mostly a passive activity Therefore, our goal for this interactive, self-contained book is to provide a quick orientation to the concepts61 Textbooks have their place, but in our view, your real learning will take place when you complete the ACTIVities (see the root of the word active in there?) This is the impetus behind the current flipped classroom philosophy in traditional education If youre looking for a stand-alone textbook, there is none better than Basics of Biblical Hebrew. "],["what-is-a-flipped-classroom.html", "What is a flipped classroom?", " What is a flipped classroom? Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest applies concepts from what is called a flipped classroom. In a traditional classroom, lecture and exams are the priority What educators have started to notice was that these two aspects of teaching, though valuable for different reasons, are not when the students primary learning occurs In a flipped classroom, the activities usually thought of as homework are the priority Interactive reading (with note-taking and active-recall), worksheets, and discussion are much better vehicles for learning than a lecture Therefore, there is a deliberate emphasis on activities over lectures, assigned reading, and exams. To emphasize this emphasis, we call these ACTIVities! "],["what-are-the-activities.html", "What are the ACTIVities?", " What are the ACTIVities?

Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is focused on reading and understanding Hebrew for the English speaker If you desire to read the Hebrew Scriptures in the original language and have a greater comprehension of what you read, this course is for you! If one was looking to be a fluent writer or speaker63 of Hebrew, or teach Hebrew in a formal academic setting, this course probably would not fully meet that persons goals (although it would be a terrific first step) This course focuses on Biblical Hebrew, not Modern Hebrew If you are looking to translate can you direct me to the railway station?, we apologize, but this course will not benefit you! Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to be self-directed and (mostly) stress-free By design, it does not have the accountability and rigor of a traditional academic program By saying it does not have academic rigor, we are NOT saying this course will be easy You will likely spend many hours on this course, mostly in Anki We believe it will be a tremendous investment you can make for the kingdom and the impact you can have on others When you start to see your knowledge building up in Anki, we believe you will find it rewarding and perhaps even fun as well Those who are seeking more of an academic/seminary type of setting might fare better with a traditional, instructor-led, Hebrew course What if I am a Bible teacher? Should I take this course? We believe this course, in conjunction with Hebrew Quest, would prepare a pastor or teacher of a traditional Christian congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text to be able to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience Additionally, for those who have had first-year Hebrew at seminary (perhaps many years ago) but have struggled to apply knowledge of the original language to their vocation, or for those pastors/teachers who may have never taken a grammar course in Hebrew, our prayer is that this course, along with Hebrew Quest, will give new life to Hebrew application in that persons teaching ministry64 There are speaking activities beginning with Lesson 3, but this is more to engage additional senses in the learning process and not to become a fluent reader.
