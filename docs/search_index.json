It is an ACTIVE experience. The more you put into it, the more youll get out of it. Many Hebrew grammar courses and books treat learning Gods Holy Language as if it were just another academic exercise. Listen to a lecture, read a chapter, take a test, and youll learn Hebrew. We wish it were that simple. Hebrew, the Holy Language Way, requires active participation. Thats where our Learning Philosophy comes in. "],["the-holy-language-learning-philosophy-active-engagement.html", "The Holy Language Learning Philosophy = ACTIVE Engagement", " The Holy Language Learning Philosophy = ACTIVE Engagement In contrast, learning Hebrew the Holy Language Way is designed not just to feed you fish, but to teach you to fish1. When someone feeds you fish, you are only passively receiving. When you learn to fish you are being active; being intentional. In other words, we believe you will learn best when you actively (and dare we say passionately) engage with the Holy Scriptures. If done this way, learning Hebrew will not merely be another academic course you take, but it can be a life-changing experience. With Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, Holy Language Institute is offering yet another way for you to actively embrace the Jewishness of our faith. Hebrew Quest took you directly to the Hebrew Scriptures and brought you in touch with the Hebraic side of the Bible that, perhaps, you had never experienced before. We introduced you to a different aspect of what you may have known as the Old Testament. Maybe before Hebrew Quest, you had kept this Old Testament at a safe distance (after all, it was old and you are new!); but now you may have a new appreciation and perhaps you are building a closer friendship with what you now know as the Tanach or the Hebrew Scriptures. Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to take you to the next stage of that friendship. It is designed to take you inside the Hebrew Scriptures. Maybe its like progressing from a good friend to an intimate friend. A friend for whom you are there during the good and the bad . . . and that friend is there for you offering you wisdom and counsel. Such a friendship can be challenging, and even difficult at times2, but it can also be one of the most rewarding relationships you can have this side of heaven. Whether or not you have finished (or even started) Hebrew Quest, we believe you will find Hebrew GRAMMAR quest a fruitful and life-changing experience3 To what could this life-changing experience of learning Gods Holy Language be compared? How about a life-changing experience in Israel, Gods Holy Land. According to Dr. Wayne Stiles, to get the most out of a tour to Israel, one must undergo a degree of preparation. In fact, there are three stages of preparation Stiles says a traveler must undertake to gain maximum benefit from a Holy Land tour4 Practical Preparation Physical Preparation Spiritual Preparation We believe the exact three principles of preparation apply to learning Hebrew the Holy Language way. Read on for an explanation. Refer to Hebrew Quest, lesson 1. see Philippians 2:12 See Appendix Q&amp;A for a larger discussion on how Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest work together.

"],["practical-preparation.html", "Practical Preparation", " Practical Preparation In each lesson of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, we will give you the lay of the Hebrew Grammar land Before a big trip, you need to know the basics. For example, you need to know some basic geography: what happened where. This way, you arent totally lost when you arrive at a site and have no idea why it is significant. Since we all have electronics, you also need to know what type of electrical current and outlets are used in Israel. There are also some cultural differences, such as a more formal dress code for holy sites than we might be used to at home. You might call this getting the lay of the land. For Practical Preparation, we will give you the seven most significant things you need to know about the lesson. You might call these our learning objectives. We call them Seven Practical Points. Most importantly, our goal is to keep this discussion at a high-level. This means, where other textbooks might spend time explaining concepts to you in great detail, we will not. Our goal is to give you just enough to pique your interest and get you pointed in the right direction. We believe that you will learn best not from reading it in a book or watching a video, but you will learn best by putting concepts into practice. This is where physical preparation comes in. But first, lets talk for a minute about safety . . . your syntactical safety! Equipment Check Each lesson of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest builds upon the previous one. At the beginning of each chapter, you will have an opportunity to check whether you are familiar enough with the major concepts (and memorization where needed) from the previous lesson before you move on with your journey. We call this Equipment Check. Here, we leave the decision to proceed with your quest up to you. Be honest with yourself. If you are unsure about any area, we strongly encourage you to return to Anki for some more review.

Those who hope to passively see the country from a bus window but who could have done more had they done some exercising befhorehand, are going to miss out. For maximum benefit, travelers must be ready for a lot of walking. Most of your class time will be spent not in reading this book or watching lectures. In Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, your TRUE learning will take place during what we call ACTIVities. In fact, wed like this book to be like be your personal trainer. A trainer shows you how to do your workout safely and effectively, and then turns it over to you to do the actual lifting. In our case, your brain is doing the lifting instead of your biceps. The majority of your learning time will be spent in a free flashcard program called Anki. Please see About Anki for additional information on Anki if you are not familiar with it. Anki is the equivalent of your gym and cardio equipment for Hebrew Health Just like working out is not easy and you dont always see quick results, dont expect Anki to be easy or expect to breeze through it Just like physical exercise, if you stick with it, you will see the rewards over time In addition to Anki, some lessons will have worksheets to reinforce concepts There is an additional part of physical preparation for an Israel tour and that is dealing with jet lag after a long flight. Believe it or not, this also has a parallel with learning Hebrew Grammar. We call it, The Fog. Prepare for The Fog Learning an ancient language also comes with a concept similar to jet lag called The Fog - Hebrew GRAMMAR quest is designed to help you work through the fog. For most of us, Israel is close to halfway around the globe away from home. After such a long flight, we are unlikely to completely avoid jet lag, but we can take steps to minimize the effects and work through it as quickly as possible. Jet lag is similar to a phenomenon we can encounter when we undertake a study of a new language. Dr. Bill Mounce calls \"the fog. Many times things wont make sense until a lesson or two later A strategy suggested by Dr. Mounce is to look back at your previous victories to assure you of your progress5 Anki has structured reviews to help you keep working through your grammar jet lag Periodically, there will be Quest Quizzes in the online course Periodic checkpoints for you to assess your progress -Are you OK to continue?_ Do you need to review some more before going on?

Real-world Hebrew is based on Sephardic pronunciation11 Weve already talked about how only three of the Daghesh Lene letters need to buckup12 Another difference between Sephardic and Seminary pronunciation is how to pronounce  In academia, the consonant receives the w sound and is called Waw. In most non-academic circles, it receives the v sound and is pronounced vav. There are also significant differences when it comes to pronouncing vowels, which we will talk about in Lesson 2. For the most part, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will follow the Sephardic pronunciation Some terms like Waw consective are so prevalent in the field of Hebrew Grammar, including modern Bible software (see image), that we would be doing you a disservice if we did not refer to these as wayyiqtol and so forth. Figure 1.1: Wayyiqtol from Logos8 software This course will use Adonai or the LORD when we encounter the Tetragramaton13. Seminary Hebrew is a term borrowed from Dr. John Beckman. We dont say Seminary Hebrew to be disrespectful; we only mean to differentiate between the two pronunciation types. With Seminary Hebrew, the  without the Daghesh Lene receives something like the gh in aGHast and the  and  without the Daghesh Lene are closer to the English th like this. Pronouncing/writing/transliterating the Holy Name of God tends to be much more common in Christian academic circles. If you were to read Basics of Biblical Hebrew you would see the name Yw-h used frequently.

On your screen, you see Genesis 1:9. The black font shows the text with no vowels. Over time, vowel notation was developed by the Masorites - these are the symbols in red that are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of, or over the affected consonant to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these dots and dashes is nikudot. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which are used for chanting the verses. These marks also show where the words accent is.
