[["3-hebrew-vowels.html", "Lesson 3 Hebrew Vowels", " Lesson 3 Hebrew Vowels To comprehend Biblical Hebrew, we must understand how words are formed and pronounced As Izzy says in Hebrew Quest, Vowels are important. Even though our goal may not necessarily be to converse in Biblical Hebrew, hearing the languages sound aids our learning. Vowels are what give a language its distinctive sound, and are what give words their meaning. Consider the simple English words bay, boy, and buy. These words have identical consonants but mean very different things because of the different vowels. It is the same with Hebrew. library(knitr) include_graphics(&quot;images/02.Gen0109.png&quot;) Above, you see Genesis 1:9. The black font shows the text with no vowels. Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red. These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is nikudot. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses. These marks also show where the words accent is.1 We will talk more about Cantillation marks in Unit 3.

"],["3-6-defective-spelling.html", "3.6 Defective and plene spelling", " 3.6 Defective and plene spelling In defective spelling, letter vowels can sometimes drop their letter and take on the corresponding non-letter vowel.

As you progress, youll start to develop a mental checklist when you encounter something that does not seem to follow the regular rules. Asking yourself, Could this be a defective spelling? will be one of those checklist items. An unchangeable long vowel written defectively is still an unchangeable long vowel A Qibbuts that is not defective is a short vowel A Qibbuts that is a defective Shureq is an unchangeable long vowel For now, do not be concerned about the difference. As we progress in the course, you will see this in action. Defective, in this sense, does not have a negative connotation.

When a Vav has a Dagesh Forte, it looks like this . Does that remind you of anything? Maybe something we just discussed on the previous page? * Thats right. A Vav with a Dagesh Forte  is identical to a Shurek . * Its surprisingly easy to tell the difference: if there is an additional vowel either under or over the same letter, or if the preceding consonant has a vowel, the letter is a Vav with Dagesh. A Shurek will never have a separate vowel following or preceding. Advanced tip: When you see a Dagesh Forte, it often means that another letter has disappeared10. We will talk more about this later in the course. Its good to think of the Dagesh Forte as the Doubling Dagesh since it doubles the consonant and often changes a words meaning. Conversely, we can think of the Dagesh Lene as the Meaningless Dagesh since it does not ever change a words meaning Mayim is one syllable as we will learn in Lesson 3.  means the heavens.
