If you are familiar with our ministry, you know our flagship course Hebrew Quest, which introduces our students to the Jewishness of our Messiah and our Bible. Hebrew Quest was designed to get students into the Hebrew text as quickly as possible, with minimal focus on learning rules. For many of our students, this approach is quite successful; but, we also noticed other students began to drop off between lessons 12 and 16. These are the grammar lessons in between the Aleph-Bet (1-11) and the study passages (17-40). For some, these lessons were too much Hebrew grammar too fast, and for others it was not enough Hebrew grammar. As we searched for a resource to recommend to these students, we noticed that they tended to fall into one of two camps: A workbook or a series of videos that are entirely self-paced/self-directed. There may be some exercises, but generally tend to not be rigorous from an academic standpoint. Additionally, with this format, there is no way for a student to get feedback on progress. Academic/Seminary level textbooks and courses. These materials are extremely rigorous with copious amounts of reading, rote memorization of paradigms, and in the case of courses, lectures and exams The textbooks generally are much more detailed and advanced than most of our students need (or would enjoy). For example, there is usually an emphasis on Hebrew writing, such as learning how to convert a noun from singular to plural. The pace of these courses is usually fast, and the stress level is high, focusing on due dates and grades. Additionally, with either option, our students would incur additional fees to purchase these materials. This is something we wanted to avoid. Although many of the resources we researched are top-notch, they were not quite what we were seeking for our students. (continued) "],["our-course.html", "Grammar course wishlist", " Grammar course wishlist So what were we seeking? In terms of content and rigor, the course would be academically challenging, but it would still be enjoyable with a low-stress level. The course would be self-paced for independent learning but provide feedback and encouragement. The course must align with our Holy Language Learning Philosophy: emphasize active forms of learning over tons of reading and long lectures. It should seamlessly mesh with Hebrew Quest. From a technological standpoint, the course must be inexpensive and straightforward to deliver and maintain, while at the same time being high-quality and visually pleasant. The course should be easy to use (and if at all possible, free) for our students. Most importantly, the course must be Yeshua-centered that approaches learning Hebrew grammar as a spiritual as well as an academic endeavor (which is also a big part of our Learning Philosophy).

Vowels are what give a language its distinctive sound. In Hebrew, the same three consonants can change meaning depending on the vowel combination. As Izzy says in Hebrew Quest, Vowels are important. On your screen, you see Genesis 1:9. The black font shows the text with no vowels. Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red. These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is nikudot. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses.

Nouns consist of a person, place, thing, or idea and can be singular or plural. Hebrew also introduces the concept of gender. In this lesson we will review aspects of the Hebrew noun with specific attention focused on the rules of pluralization. LESSON ITINERARY Understand Noun Gender and Number Examine singular noun endings and endingless nouns for both Masculine and Feminine nouns Examine endings for plural and dual nouns Identify special dual forms Examine other/irregular Pluralization Describe the Rule of Sheva Define what is meant by Lexical Form EQUIPMENT CHECK Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts? Vowel and syllable preference The rules for Silent Sheva and Vocal Sheva Additionally, starting with this lesson we will invoke the shorthand weve been learning in Anki (e.g. MP = Masculine Plural, FS = Feminine singular). Parsing vs Inflecting: Many Hebrew grammar books expect students to know how to pluralize nouns in writing. This is called inflecting. Inflecting is when we take a base word and do something with it, such as change its gender or number. When those books get to verbs, they spend a lot of effort focused on taking a base verb and inflecting it into all the different forms (person, gender, number, active, passive, reflexive, and so forth). Parsing is somewhat of the opposite concept where you take an inflected word and break it down into its base form. Reading the Hebrew Bible does not require you to inflect a noun or a verb; however, reading the Bible does require you to parse a word. This is so that you are able identify the lexical form and understand what the word means means (or if you dont know what it means, how to look it up in a dictionary). Our objective with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is only that you know how to parse words. Beginning with this lesson you will see an Anki chapter called Workbook, which will have some activities like parsing. The ability to inflect IS a great skill to have to master the language. If you wish to dig deeper and get into inflecting, we encourage you to check out Basics of Biblical Hebrew or another suitable textbook or workbook.

However, an overarching facet of Hebrew is that two reduced vowels in a row cannot stand. The Rule of Sheva changes the first of two reduced vowels into the corresponding short vowel. The first of two contiguous Vocal Sheva will usually change to a Hireq. Note the unique situation when the second consonant is a Yod: These next two could be called Hateph copy-cat rules. Notice how the vowel under the first consonant in all six examples takes on the short-vowel equivalent of the hateph vowel: A hateph vowel under a Guttural that is followed by a Vocal Sheva will change to the short vowel in the same class (e.g. hateph patach to patach) A Vocal Sheva that is followed by a hateph vowel will change to the short-vowel in the same class as the hateph vowel.

For example, when added to a verb, it often indicates a advancing the narrative. It also has a special use on a verb (depending on the vowel) of changing the verbs aspect. Well address that in Chapter 17. When added to a non-verb it is often those stage directions we mentioned: a contrast, a scene shift, or a parenthetical comment. Many times, it makes the most sense in English to leave the Vav untranslated. For example, suppose you read and translate the story of David and Goliath in 1 Samuel 17. You would discover that nearly every sentence would begin with and. In English, we would consider these run-on sentences. What is exciting about the Hebrew, and this passage in particular, is that the reader can feel the sense of tension and action building in the narrative by the use of the Vav. As you are starting out in Hebrew, start your translation of the Vav Conjunction with And, but be flexible. Another word, such as but or then might make more sense. Many times for smooth English, we will leave the Vav untranslated.

When the nun appears with a SILENT sheva  (or no vowel at all) is one of those times. You remember how we said that the Daghesh Forte is your friend, because it tells you that something has changed? When then nun drops, whenever possible it will be replaced with a Daghesh Forte. The technical term for this is called assimilation.

In Hebrew, there are three different types of Hebrew prepositions: independent, Maqqef, and inseparable. An independent preposition is a separate word with a space before it and after it. The preposition comes first, followed by its object (just like English). E.g.,   (under it) Maqqef is a mark like the English hyphen. They are nearly identical in meaning and appearance except the Hebrew maqqef is raised  whereas the English is middle -. Like the hyphen used to join two English words, the maqqef lets us know that two Hebrew words are closely connected grammatically. In a Maqqef preposition, the maqqef connects a preposition to its object. Again, the preposition comes first. . English prepositions are NOT written this way. You would never see on-a-king. You may see the same preposition written both with and without the Maqqef. The meaning does not change.   means the same as  One notable aspect about the maqqef is that the word loses its accent.

In the lexical form of these prepositions, there is a vocal sheva vowel under the buckle consonant. If there is a Sheva or Hateph vowel in the next letter, the Rules of Sheva come into play.

For example, note how we would spell in the field: For words that keep the pathach and daghesh forte of the article, it is straightforward to determine the article. The challenge comes when the next letter rejects the Daghesh Forte. Heres how to tell whether there is the article with a preposition: NO ARTICLE if there is a Sheva under the preposition - the article never takes a Sheva NO ARTICLE if the short vowel under the preposition can be explained by the Rules of Sheva:  +  =  - for men, (not for the men) ARTICLE if vowel under the preposition is not Sheva and can NOT be explain by the Rule of Sheva:  = for THE temple Some situations will be ambiguous.

In Lesson 6, we talked about inseparable prepositions, which are one-letter prefixes to words. Pronominal suffixes work similarly, except as the name suffix implies, these go on the back of words instead of the front. On a noun, a pronominal suffix indicates the one who owns or is related to the noun: His books / her houses / their house / our father On a preposition, the suffix indicates the object: to her / with them / behind him / in front of it Verbs also take pronominal suffixes, which will indicate the verbs object. We will study these in Lesson 19. Pronominal suffixes have gender, number, and person. Whereas independent personal pronouns were always subject pronouns (e.g., I, she, he, it and they), pronominal suffixes are always object or possessive pronouns (e.g., me, my, her, him, them, theirs). You can be an ambiguous term in English, not only with number and gender but also, you can be either a subject or object.

A construct chain consists of at least two nouns linked together. The first important thing to know about a Hebrew construct chain is this: The very last noun in the chain is said to be in the absolute state. All words in the chain before the absolute noun are said to be in construct state. Back to  , house of bread bread would be in the absolute state house of is in the construct state The entire phrase, with one and only one absolute noun and one or more construct nouns, would be called a construct chain. The purpose of the chain is to describe the first noun in the chain. It might be reasonable to think that the chain would be describing the noun in the absolute state, but that is not the case. In  , we are describing the house, not the bread Note that we said the first NOUN in the chain If there were a substantival adjective as the first word, e.g. wise of heart, the chain is describing heart not wise. A chain describes the first NOUN in the chain, not necessarily the first word in the chain. In English, we would typically add the word of after each word in the construct state. * We could say the kings son or the son of the king, and both would mean the same thing * Translating a construct word as of is a starting point and not a hard-and-fast requirement Just like we may add 's, Hebrew has different spelling for nouns in construct. The absolute noun is the normal spelling and meaning. "],["10-2-what-makes-a-construct-chain.html", "10.2 What makes a construct chain", " 10.2 What makes a construct chain What makes a Hebrew construct chain different is that nothing else comes between the words of the chain. In English, we could add an adjective like the servant of the wicked son of the king. In Hebrew, any adjectives must come after the whole chain. A literal translation would look like: servant of son of the king the wicked. To resolve, we would need to go back and determine which word the adjective modifies by matching the gender and number. In the example above, there is ambiguity. Without more context, it is impossible to determine which of the three men is the wicked one. Translating is more straightforward when the nouns in the construct chain are of a mixed number or gender. For example: the wife of David the strong the smart, the beautiful. If strong and beautiful were FS then we know they are referring to Davids wife. If smart was MS, we know it is referring to David. The sentence translation would be clear: The strong and beautiful wife of smart David.

A word is definite if it: Has the article -  Has a pronominal suffix -  Is a proper noun -  Is in a construct chain where the last, absolute, word is definite -   = THE son of the king This brings us to a critical concept about construct chains: Nouns in construct state NEVER take the article.

While the Lessons and other materials will continue to use these simple accents, from now on, we will graduate to using the full set of Hebrew accents in our Study Verses and Workbook exercises. Why do this? When you read from a Tanach, you are much more likely to encounter the complete set of Hebrew accent marks. So part of becoming more comfortable with the Hebrew Bible must include a basic familiarity with these additional marks. Things to keep in mind: There are over 20 different cantilation marks. We wont go into what each one means, but there are plenty of resources on the Internet if you are interested in digging deeper If you see a mark that is not a vowel you recognize (such as an upside-down wishbone) or in the wrong place (such as a dot above a consonant instead of inside or below) it is a cantillation mark Remember that a syllable can have only one vowel Most often there is only one cantillation mark per word - where you see the mark is where the accent goes Occasionally you will see a mark near the front or middle of the word and a mark near the end of a word. The first mark is a secondary accent. Remember, a primary Hebrew accent can ONLY be on the LAST or SECOND-TO-LAST syllable The vertical line | that can appear between two words can be ignored When in doubt, listen to Izzys audio carefully as he reads each verse, to determine where the accent goes Trying to read with these marks can be visually distracting and overwhelming at first, but with practice you will get used to them.

Naomi is elaborating on why she wants a new name. We have noted that most Hebrew clauses begin with a verb, but 1:21 begins with I. Naomi is drawing attention to her condition - full when she left, but now returning empty. Curiously, Ruth evidently counts for nothing. Naomis attitude will definitely change by the end of the book! Also note in 1:21 the Disjunctive Vav clauses, And Adonai followed by And Shaddai. Chisholm notes that the use may be semi-poetic: Adonai has testified about me; Shaddai has afflicted me64.

Hebrew Quest, starting with Lesson 16, is all about reading Hebrew77. To say it differently, Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest complement one another in a circular (and maybe slightly paradoxical!) form: The more Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, and The more Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew Quest Either way, you cant go wrong!

The second-best time is today. Whichever direction you take, we would encourage you to ultimately complete both Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.

Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to be self-directed and (mostly) stress-free. By design, it does not have the accountability and rigor of a traditional academic program.

We believe this course, in conjunction with Hebrew Quest, would prepare a pastor or teacher of a traditional Christian or Messianic congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text to be able to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience. Additionally, for those who have had first-year Hebrew at seminary (perhaps many years ago) but have struggled to apply knowledge of the original language to their vocation, or for those pastors/teachers who may have never taken a grammar course in Hebrew, our prayer is that this course, along with Hebrew Quest, will give new life to Hebrew application in that persons teaching ministry82. This books compiler can testify to this! "],["D-lexicon.html", "D Lexicon", " D Lexicon The authors of Basics of Biblical Hebrew have created an abridged Lexicon to accompany this course.

He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of Hebrew Quest Memrise and now Hebrew Grammar Quest This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the designer or compiler of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the author of a static book Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college.
