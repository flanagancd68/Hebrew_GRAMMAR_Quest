It is an ACTIVE experience. The more you put into it, the more youll get out of it. Many Hebrew grammar courses and books treat learning Gods Holy Language as if it were just another academic exercise. Listen to a lecture, read a chapter, take a test, and youll learn Hebrew. We wish it were that simple. Hebrew, the Holy Language Way, requires active participation. Thats where our Learning Philosophy comes in. "],["the-holy-language-learning-philosophy-active-engagement.html", "The Holy Language Learning Philosophy = ACTIVE Engagement", " The Holy Language Learning Philosophy = ACTIVE Engagement In contrast, learning Hebrew the Holy Language Way is designed not just to feed you fish, but to teach you to fish1. When someone feeds you fish, you are only passively receiving. When you learn to fish you are being active; being intentional. In other words, we believe you will learn best when you actively (and dare we say passionately) engage with the Holy Scriptures. If done this way, learning Hebrew will not merely be another academic course you take, but it can be a life-changing experience. With Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, Holy Language Institute is offering yet another way for you to actively embrace the Jewishness of our faith. Hebrew Quest took you directly to the Hebrew Scriptures and brought you in touch with the Hebraic side of the Bible that, perhaps, you had never experienced before. We introduced you to a different aspect of what you may have known as the Old Testament. Maybe before Hebrew Quest, you had kept this Old Testament at a safe distance (after all, it was old and you are new!); but now you may have a new appreciation and perhaps you are building a closer friendship with what you now know as the Tanach or the Hebrew Scriptures. Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to take you to the next stage of that friendship. It is designed to take you inside the Hebrew Scriptures. Maybe its like progressing from a good friend to an intimate friend. A friend for whom you are there during the good and the bad . . . and that friend is there for you offering you wisdom and counsel. Such a friendship can be challenging, and even difficult at times2, but it can also be one of the most rewarding relationships you can have this side of heaven. Whether or not you have finished (or even started) Hebrew Quest, we believe you will find Hebrew GRAMMAR quest a fruitful and life-changing experience3 To what could this life-changing experience of learning Gods Holy Language be compared? How about a life-changing experience in Israel, Gods Holy Land. According to Dr. Wayne Stiles, to get the most out of a tour to Israel, one must undergo a degree of preparation. In fact, there are three stages of preparation Stiles says a traveler must undertake to gain maximum benefit from a Holy Land tour4 Practical Preparation Physical Preparation Spiritual Preparation We believe the exact three principles of preparation apply to learning Hebrew the Holy Language way. Read on for an explanation. Refer to Hebrew Quest, lesson 1. see Philippians 2:12 See Appendix Q&amp;A for a larger discussion on how Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest work together.

"],["practical-preparation.html", "Practical Preparation", " Practical Preparation In each lesson of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, we will give you the lay of the Hebrew Grammar land Before a big trip, you need to know the basics. For example, you need to know some basic geography: what happened where. This way, you arent totally lost when you arrive at a site and have no idea why it is significant. Since we all have electronics, you also need to know what type of electrical current and outlets are used in Israel. There are also some cultural differences, such as a more formal dress code for holy sites than we might be used to at home. You might call this getting the lay of the land. For Practical Preparation, we will give you the seven most significant things you need to know about the lesson. You might call these our learning objectives. We call them Seven Practical Points. Most importantly, our goal is to keep this discussion at a high-level. This means, where other textbooks might spend time explaining concepts to you in great detail, we will not. Our goal is to give you just enough to pique your interest and get you pointed in the right direction. We believe that you will learn best not from reading it in a book or watching a video, but you will learn best by putting concepts into practice. This is where physical preparation comes in.

Those who hope to passively see the country from a bus window but who could have done more had they done some exercising befhorehand, are going to miss out. For maximum benefit, travelers must be ready for a lot of walking. Most of your class time will be spent not in reading this book or watching lectures. In Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, your TRUE learning will take place during what we call ACTIVities. In fact, wed like this book to be like be your personal trainer. A trainer shows you how to do your workout safely and effectively, and then turns it over to you to do the actual lifting. In our case, your brain is doing the lifting instead of your biceps. The majority of your learning time will be spent in a free flashcard program called Anki. Please see About Anki for additional information on Anki if you are not familiar with it. Anki is the equivalent of your gym and cardio equipment for Hebrew Health Just like working out is not easy and you dont always see quick results, dont expect Anki to be easy or expect to breeze through it Just like physical exercise, if you stick with it, you will see the rewards over time In addition to Anki, some lessons will have worksheets to reinforce concepts There is an additional part of physical preparation for an Israel tour and that is dealing with jet lag after a long flight. Believe it or not, this also has a parallel with learning Hebrew Grammar. We call it, The Fog. Prepare for The Fog Learning an ancient language also comes with a concept similar to jet lag called The Fog - Hebrew GRAMMAR quest is designed to help you work through the fog. For most of us, Israel is close to halfway around the globe away from home. After such a long flight, we are unlikely to completely avoid jet lag, but we can take steps to minimize the effects and work through it as quickly as possible. Jet lag is similar to a phenomenon we can encounter when we undertake a study of a new language. Dr. Bill Mounce calls \"the fog. Many times things wont make sense until a lesson or two later A strategy suggested by Dr. Mounce is to look back at your previous victories to assure you of your progress5 Anki has structured reviews to help you keep working through your grammar jet lag Periodically, there will be Quest Quizzes in the online course Periodic checkpoints for you to assess your progress -Are you OK to continue?_ Do you need to review some more before going on? If you do, thats perfectly ok Its all part of working through the fog.

"],["one-7.html", "1.7 Sephardic vs Seminary Pronunciation", " 1.7 Sephardic vs Seminary Pronunciation There are some notable differences between what we might call academic or seminary Hebrew and real-world Hebrew. Real-world Hebrew is based on Sephardic pronunciation11 Weve already talked about how only three of the Daghesh Lene letters need to buckup12 Another difference between Sephardic and Seminary pronunciation is how to pronounce  In academia, the consonant receives the w sound and is called Waw. In most non-academic circles, it receives the v sound and is pronounced vav. There are also significant differences when it comes to pronouncing vowels, which we will talk about in Lesson 2. For the most part, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will follow the Sephardic pronunciation Some terms like Waw consective are so prevalent in the field of Hebrew Grammar, including modern Bible software (see image), that we would be doing you a disservice if we did not refer to these as wayyiqtol and so forth. Figure 1.1: Wayyiqtol from Logos8 software This course will use Adonai or the LORD when we encounter the Tetragramaton13. Seminary Hebrew is a term borrowed from Dr. John Beckman. We dont say Seminary Hebrew to be disrespectful; we only mean to differentiate between the two pronunciation types. With Seminary Hebrew, the  without the Daghesh Lene receives something like the gh in aGHast and the  and  without the Daghesh Lene are closer to the English th like this. Pronouncing/writing/transliterating the Holy Name of God tends to be much more common in Christian academic circles. If you were to read Basics of Biblical Hebrew you would see the name Yw-h used frequently. We do know of academians, such as Dr. John Beckman and Dr. Robert Cargill, who will use the circumlocution of respect instead of pronouncing the name, so this is not a hard and fast Academic distinction "],["one-8.html", "1.8 Lesson 1 ACTIVities", " 1.8 Lesson 1 ACTIVities Physical Anki Aerobics Vocabulary - Learn (or relearn) the Aleph-Bet with Izzy Grammar - Identify look-alike Hebrew letters Worksheets Practice writing the letters using the Letter Writing worksheet Practice writing the AlephBet in order until you can do it at least five times from memory using the Blank writing paper Spiritual Anki Aerobics Study-Verses - there is no translation yet but we will learn some grammar shorthand that we will use when we get to the study verses Ruth Pursuit (Use Ruth 1 Blank Copy14 Identify the four guttural letters (pink)15 Identify the one half-guttural (red) Identify the six BeGaD KePHaT letters, both with and without the Daghesh Lene for a total of 12 letters (green) Identify the five final/sofit forms (blue) Identify the remaining letters (yellow) (Ruth Answer Key #1) Physical Quest Quiz #1 After completing all of the other ACTIVities, complete the Quest Quiz #116 to assess your progress Click the link (and sign in with a Google account if necessary), then click Open with Google Docs to highlight the letters.

Both courses are born of the same Holy Language Learning philosophy: the optimal way to interact with the Sacred Scriptures is by doing Hebrew Quest was intentionally designed to get students into Hebrew texts with as little grammar as possible Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to fill a gap for those students who want to know more about the inner workings of Hebrew, but wish to do so in a fun, low pressure format (as opposed to taking a formal Hebrew course or trying to read an academic-level textbook on their own) Also, we know that everyone learns a little differently Many are able view the 40 lessons of Hebrew Quest, and they get it with respect to Hebrew Others may have found themselves getting stuck on the grammar sections of Hebrew Quest and need some more in-depth grammar preparation before returning to the study passages Still others made it through some or all of Hebrew Quest and just have a desire to know more Wherever you find yourself, if you have an interest in digging deeper, you have come to the right place!

Emphatically - No! This grammar course starts from the beginning (with learning the Aleph-bet) and assumes no prior knowledge of Hebrew With that said, the more of Hebrew Quest you have completed the easier you may find it is to work through the grammar material If we were to categorize as good, better, best in terms of Hebrew Quest completion, heres what we would say: Good: You have completed some or no Hebrew Quest lessons This means that the first three lessons of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest might take you a little longer, but, once you have that foundation, youll be up to speed Better: You have completed through Hebrew Quest Lesson 12 (the Aleph-bet and Vowels) This means the first three lessons will go a little more quickly for you Best: You have completed through Lesson 15 (verbs) and beyond This means that more of the concepts presented in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will tend be things you have heard before, versus brand new "],["when-i-complete-this-course-should-i-go-back-and-finish-hebrew-quest.html", "When I complete this course, should I go back and finish Hebrew Quest?", " When I complete this course, should I go back and finish Hebrew Quest? ABSOLUTELY! In fact, the most logical next step after completing a first-year Hebrew grammar course is to dig into the Scriptures and start reading Hebrew Quest, starting with Lesson 16 is all about reading Hebrew29 In other words, Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest compliment each other in a circular (and maybe slightly paradoxical) way: The more Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, and The more Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew Quest Either way, you cant go wrong! Although, with your deeper knowledge you may be able to go a little faster.

As we say above, we want students to learn by doing While Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will cover the same concepts as a typical first-year Hebrew textbook, the instructional design team at Holy Language Institute are huge proponents of active learning as opposed to passive learning Reading a book is largely a passive activity Therefore, our goal for this book and the accompanying lectures, is to simply provide a quick orientation to the concepts30 Textbooks have their place, but in our view, your real learning will take place when you complete the ACTIVities (see root of the word active in there?) This is the impetus behind the current flipped classroom philosophy in traditional education In fact, if youre looking for a stand-alone textbook, there is none better than Basics of Biblical Hebrew. "],["what-is-a-flipped-classroom.html", "What is a flipped classroom?", " What is a flipped classroom? Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest applies concepts from what is called a flipped classroom In a traditional classroom, lecture and exams are the priority What educators have started to notice was that these two aspects of teaching, though valuable for different reasons, are not when the students primary learning occurs In a flipped classroom, the activities usually thought of as homework are the priority Interactive reading (with note-taking and active-recall), worksheets, and discussion are much better vehicles for learning than a lecture Therefore in Hebrew GRAMMAR quest there is an intentional de-emphasis on lectures and exams and an intentional emphasis on activities - in fact to emphasize this emphasis we call these ACTIVities!

Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is focused on reading and understanding Hebrew for the English speaker If you desire to read the Hebrew Scriptures in the original language and have a greater comprehension of what you read, this course is for you! If one was looking to be a fluent writer or speaker of Hebrew, or teach Hebrew in a formal academic setting, this course probably would not fully meet that persons goals (although it would be a great first step) This course focuses on Biblical Hebrew, not Modern Hebrew If you are looking to translate can you direct me to the railway station?, we apologize, but this course will not benefit you! Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to be self-directed and (mostly) stress-free By design, it does not have the accountability and rigor of a traditional academic program By saying it does not have academic rigor, we are NOT saying this course will be easy You will likely spend many hours on this course, mostly in Anki We believe it will be a tremendous investment you can make for the kingdom and the impact you can have on others When you start to see your knowledge building up in Anki, we believe you will find it rewarding and perhaps even fun as well Those who seeking more of an academic/seminary type of setting might fare better with a traditional, instructor-led, Hebrew course What if I am a Bible teacher? Should I take this course? We believe this course, in conjunction with Hebrew Quest, would prepare a pastor or teacher of a traditional Christian congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text to be able to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience Additionally, for those who have had first-year Hebrew at seminary (perhaps many years ago) but have struggled to apply knowledge of the original language to their vocation, or for those pastors/teachers who may have never taken a grammar course in Hebrew, our prayer is that this course, along with Hebrew Quest, will give new life to Hebrew application in that persons teaching ministry32 This books author can testify to this!
