If you are familiar with our ministry, you know our flagship course Hebrew Quest, which introduces our students to the Jewishness of our Messiah and our Bible. Hebrew Quest was designed to get students into the Hebrew text as quickly as possible, with minimal focus on learning rules. For many of our students, this approach is quite successful; but, we also noticed other students began to drop off between lessons 12 and 16. These are the grammar lessons in between the Aleph-Bet (1-11) and the study passages (17-40). For some, these lessons were too much Hebrew grammar too fast, and for others it was not enough Hebrew grammar. As we searched for a resource to recommend to these students, we noticed that they tended to fall into one of two camps: A workbook or a series of videos that are entirely self-paced/self-directed. There may be some exercises, but generally tend to not be rigorous from an academic standpoint. Additionally, with this format, there is no way for a student to get feedback on progress. Academic/Seminary level textbooks and courses. These materials are extremely rigorous with copious amounts of reading, rote memorization of paradigms, and in the case of courses, lectures and exams The textbooks generally are much more detailed and advanced than most of our students need (or would enjoy). For example, there is usually an emphasis on Hebrew writing, such as learning how to convert a noun from singular to plural. The pace of these courses is usually fast, and the stress level is high, focusing on due dates and grades. Additionally, with either option, our students would incur additional fees to purchase these materials. This is something we wanted to avoid. Although many of the resources we researched are top-notch, they were not quite what we were seeking for our students. (continued) "],["our-course.html", "Grammar course wishlist", " Grammar course wishlist So what were we seeking? In terms of content and rigor, the course would be academically challenging, but it would still be enjoyable with a low-stress level. The course would be self-paced for independent learning but provide feedback and encouragement. The course must align with our Holy Language Learning Philosophy: emphasize active forms of learning over tons of reading and long lectures. It should seamlessly mesh with Hebrew Quest. From a technological standpoint, the course must be inexpensive and straightforward to deliver and maintain, while at the same time being high-quality and visually pleasant. The course should be easy to use (and if at all possible, free) for our students. Most importantly, the course must be Yeshua-centered that approaches learning Hebrew grammar as a spiritual as well as an academic endeavor (which is also a big part of our Learning Philosophy).

Vowels are what give a language its distinctive sound. In Hebrew, the same three consonants can change meaning depending on the vowel combination. As Izzy says in Hebrew Quest, Vowels are important. On your screen, you see Genesis 1:9. The black font shows the text with no vowels. Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red. These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is nikudot. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses.

Nouns consist of a person, place, thing, or idea and can be singular or plural. Hebrew also introduces the concept of gender. In this lesson we will review aspects of the Hebrew noun with specific attention focused on the rules of pluralization. LESSON ITINERARY Understand Noun Gender and Number Examine singular noun endings and endingless nouns for both Masculine and Feminine nouns Examine endings for plural and dual nouns Identify special dual forms Examine other/irregular Pluralization Describe the Rule of Sheva Define what is meant by Lexical Form EQUIPMENT CHECK Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts? Vowel and syllable preference The rules for Silent Sheva and Vocal Sheva Additionally, starting with this lesson we will invoke the shorthand weve been learning in Anki (e.g. MP = Masculine Plural, FS = Feminine singular). Parsing vs Inflecting: Many Hebrew grammar books expect students to know how to pluralize nouns in writing. This is called inflecting. Inflecting is when we take a base word and do something with it, such as change its gender or number. When those books get to verbs, they spend a lot of effort focused on taking a base verb and inflecting it into all the different forms (person, gender, number, active, passive, reflexive, and so forth). Parsing is somewhat of the opposite concept where you take an inflected word and break it down into its base form. Reading the Hebrew Bible does not require you to inflect a noun or a verb; however, reading the Bible does require you to parse a word. This is so that you are able identify the lexical form and understand what the word means means (or if you dont know what it means, how to look it up in a dictionary). Our objective with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is only that you know how to parse words. Beginning with this lesson you will see an Anki chapter called Workbook, which will have some activities like parsing. The ability to inflect IS a great skill to have to master the language. If you wish to dig deeper and get into inflecting, we encourage you to check out Basics of Biblical Hebrew or another suitable textbook or workbook.

Many two syllable words accented on the penult are classified as Segholate nouns. They get this name because frequently, though not always, there are two Seghol vowels.  (boy, youth) is a segholate noun even though it doesnt have any Seghol vowels. If a plural word has Vocal Sheva/Hateph under the first consonant and Qamets under the second, with the normal MP or FP ending, the word is likely a Segholate noun.  to   to   to  Geminate words take a Daghesh Forte Geminate (from the Latin for twins) words appear to have two visible letters (which we call biconsonantal), but at one point the second consonant appeared twice.

So in our example,  becomes  (peoples). The reason we dont have a Daghesh Forte in  is that the last consonant of a word rejects the Daghesh Forte when it has no vowel. "],["rules-sheva.html", "4.6 Rule of Sheva", " 4.6 Rule of Sheva Sometimes, according to other rules of grammar, we end up with a scenario where we have two reduced vowels, such as two vocal sheva, back to back. However, an overarching facet of Hebrew is that two reduced vowels in a row cannot stand. The Rule of Sheva changes the first of two reduced vowels into the corresponding short vowel. The first of two contiguous Vocal Sheva will usually change to a Hireq. Note the unique situation when the second consonant is a Yod: These next two could be called Hateph copy-cat rules. Notice how the vowel under the first consonant in all six examples takes on the short-vowel equivalent of the hateph vowel: A hateph vowel under a Guttural that is followed by a Vocal Sheva will change to the short vowel in the same class (e.g. hateph patach to patach) A Vocal Sheva that is followed by a hateph vowel will change to the short-vowel in the same class as the hateph vowel.

In that case, you may be looking at a grammatical scenario where there were originally been two reduced vowels. You may be wondering why you need to know this.

Admittedly, this is a challenge for us as we are just learning Hebrew Grammar, but it is important to keep this in mind. Most often, it simply means and. Other options include: then, and then, but, also, even, together with, that is. As you advance in Hebrew, you will enjoy seeing how the authors employ the Vav at the beginning of a sentence or clause to evoke different meanings. For example, when added to a verb, it often indicates a advancing the narrative. It also has a special use on a verb (depending on the vowel) of changing the verbs aspect. Well address that in Chapter 17. When added to a non-verb it is often those stage directions we mentioned: a contrast, a scene shift, or a parenthetical comment. Many times, it makes the most sense in English to leave the Vav untranslated. For example, suppose you read and translate the story of David and Goliath in 1 Samuel 17. You would discover that nearly every sentence would begin with and. In English, we would consider these run-on sentences.

Weve discussed two of those already: It is ALWAYS rejected by the Gutturals and Resh (2.7) It is ALWAYS rejected when it would go inside the last consonant of a word when it has no vowel (4.5) Now we add a third. This one is very technical, so please dont worry if you dont understand this at first. There is a group of consonants that SOMETIMES rejects the Daghesh Forte, but only when those consonants have a Sheva They are called the SQiN eM LeVY letters S -  the sibilants (letters that make an S sound) Q -  N -  M -  L -  V -  Y -  If youre expecting a Daghesh Forte and there isnt one, look to see if the next letter has a SQiN eM LeVY letter with a Sheva.

In the lexical form of these prepositions, there is a vocal sheva vowel under the buckle consonant. If there is a Sheva or Hateph vowel in the next letter, the Rules of Sheva come into play.

For example, note how we would spell in the field: For words that keep the pathach and daghesh forte of the article, it is straightforward to determine the article. The challenge comes when the next letter rejects the Daghesh Forte. Heres how to tell whether there is the article or not: NO ARTICLE if there is a Sheva under the preposition - the article never takes a Sheva NO ARTICLE if the short vowel under the preposition can be explained by the Rules of Sheva:  +  =  - for men, (not for the men) ARTICLE if vowel under the preposition is not Sheva and can NOT be explain by the Rule of Sheva:  = for THE temple Some situations will be ambiguous; the context will guide us.

We will use the paradigm word  to illustrate An adjective is either masculine or feminine An adjective is either singular or plural (dual nouns take plural adjectives) An adjective will match the gender and number of the noun that it modifies or for which it substitutes Note that for irregular nouns, the adjective will not necessarily match the exact ending   - even though  has the irregular -im ending, the adjective  remains the regular feminine plural An adjectives will use expected endings Unlike nouns, adjectives can inflect across genders in order to match the respective gender of the noun. The Lexical Form of an adjective is the MS. MS is usually endingless but can be seghol hei as in , which is MS for pleasing, beautiful. Note that unlike , most adjectives undergo vowel changes when the inflectional endings are added. The good news is you already know this, because it is the same for adjectives as it is for nouns. Perhaps a bit more foreign (unless you were an English major) are the concepts of Substantival, Attributive and Predicative uses of the adjective.

"],["substantival-use.html", "7.2 Substantival Use", " 7.2 Substantival Use In the Substantival use, the adjective acts as a noun. We could say the Substantiv Substitutes for a noun. Perhaps an obvious example of this from pop culture is the film, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. The three words, good, bad and ugly are adjectives being used as nouns. In a sense the noun is implied. It could be the good ones or the bad man. The Substantival use in Hebrew is relatively easy to identify. You will see an adjective but there will be no related noun that matches in gender and number.  - the good (feminine singular something).

The good book is an example of the Attributive use. Hebrew makes it much easier to identify the Attributive use. The adjective MUST come AFTER the noun it modifies, and it MUST match in definiteness - meaning either both the noun and the adjective have the definite article or they both will not have the article. In fact, there is an easy mnemonic we can use: Attributive After noun, Article Agrees   - the good woman   - a good woman (or the woman is good-predicate use; see next section) "],["predicative-use.html", "7.4 Predicative Use", " 7.4 Predicative Use The Predicative use (often called the predicate use) asserts something about the noun. The noun is the subject and the adjective is the predicate of the sentence: The book is good. The Predicative use is more flexible than the Attributive, in that the adjective can be either before or after the noun. One way to differentiate it from the Attributive use is the Predicative use WILL NOT have the Article. So a similar mnemonic could be: Predicative dePrived of the article; Perhaps Prior All of the options below can mean the woman is good:         (or attributative) As this illustrates, the only time there can be any ambiguity between Attributative and Predicative is when the adjective follows the noun and both are indefinite.

In Lesson 6, we talked about inseparable prepositions, which are one-letter prefixes to words. Pronominal suffixes work similarly, except as the name suffix implies, these go on the back of words instead of the front. On a noun, a pronominal suffix indicates the one who owns or is related to the noun: His books / her houses / their house / our father On a preposition, the suffix indicates the object: to her / with them / behind him / in front of it Verbs also take pronominal suffixes, which will indicate the verbs object. We will study these in Lesson 19. Pronominal suffixes have gender, number, and person. Whereas independent personal pronouns were always subject pronouns (e.g., I, she, he, it and they), pronominal suffixes are always object or possessive pronouns (e.g., me, my, her, him, them, theirs). You can be an ambiguous term in English, not only with number and gender but also, you can be either a subject or object. Hebrew has distinct ways of saying 2MS, 2FS, 2MP, and 2FP, as well as different forms for subject and object.

Courtesy of the Pictorial Library of Bible Lands "],["what-is-a-construct-chain.html", "10.1 What is a Construct Chain?", " 10.1 What is a Construct Chain? A construct chain consists of at least two nouns linked together. The first important thing to know about a Hebrew construct chain is this: The very last noun in the chain is said to be in the absolute state. All words in the chain before the absolute noun are said to be in construct state. Back to  , house of bread bread would be in the absolute state house of is in the construct state The entire phrase, with one and only one absolute noun and one or more construct nouns, would be called a construct chain. The purpose of the chain is to describe the first noun in the chain. It might be reasonable to think that the chain would be describing the noun in the absolute state, but that is not the case. In  , we are describing the house, not the bread Note that we said the first NOUN in the chain If there were a substantival adjective as the first word, e.g. wise of heart, the chain is describing heart not wise. A chain describes the first NOUN in the chain, not necessarily the first word in the chain. In English, we would typically add the word of after each word in the construct state. * We could say the kings son or the son of the king, and both would mean the same thing * Translating a construct word as of is a starting point and not a hard-and-fast requirement Just like we may add 's, Hebrew has different spelling for nouns in construct. The absolute noun is the normal spelling and meaning. "],["what-makes-a-construct-chain.html", "10.2 What makes a construct chain", " 10.2 What makes a construct chain What makes a Hebrew construct chain different is that nothing else comes between the words of the chain. In English, we could add an adjective like the servant of the wicked son of the king. In Hebrew, any adjectives must come after the whole chain. A literal translation would look like: servant of son of the king the wicked. To resolve, we would need to go back and determine which word the adjective modifies by matching the gender and number. In the example above, there is ambiguity. Without more context, it is impossible to determine which of the three men is the wicked one. Translating is more straightforward when the nouns in the construct chain are of a mixed number or gender. For example: the wife of David the strong the smart, the beautiful. If strong and beautiful were FS then we know they are referring to Davids wife. If smart was MS, we know it is referring to David. The sentence translation would be clear: The strong and beautiful wife of smart David.

A word is definite if it: Has the article -  Has a pronominal suffix -  Is a proper noun -  Is in a construct chain where the last, absolute, word is definite -   = THE son of the king This brings us to a critical concept about construct chains: Nouns in construct state NEVER take the article.

In fact, the most logical next step after completing a first-year Hebrew grammar course is to dig into the Scriptures and start reading. Hebrew Quest, starting with Lesson 16, is all about reading Hebrew51. To say it differently, Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest complement one another in a circular (and maybe slightly paradoxical!) form: The more Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, and The more Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew Quest Either way, you cant go wrong!

Also plan to do Hebrew Quest Memrise or Anki so you can pick up your first two Certificates as outlined here Then hop over to this course and get a firm foundation of Hebrew grammar Then go back to Hebrew Quest lesson 17 and the study passages will have extra life for you This will likely take you a long time to complete both52, but remember the proverb about the best time to plant a tree: The best time was 20 years ago. The second-best time is today. Whichever direction you take, we would encourage you to ultimately complete both Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.

If one was looking to be a fluent writer or speaker55 of Hebrew, or teach Hebrew in a formal academic setting, this course probably would not fully meet that persons goals (although it would be a terrific first step). This course focuses on Biblical Hebrew, not Modern Hebrew. If you are looking to translate can you direct me to the railway station? we apologize, but this course will not benefit you! Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is designed to be self-directed and (mostly) stress-free. By design, it does not have the accountability and rigor of a traditional academic program. By saying it does not have academic rigor, we are NOT saying this course will be easy. You will likely spend many hours on this course, mostly in Anki. We believe it will be a tremendous investment you can make for the kingdom and the impact you can have on others.

Those who are seeking more of an academic/seminary type of setting might fare better with a traditional, instructor-led, Hebrew course (but the more of THIS course you complete, the easier THAT course will be!).

He has completed Hebrew Quest as a student, which planted a desire to dig deeper into the original languages. He has completed both Hebrew and Greek courses at the seminary level. He has worked on a number of projects for HLI from an instructional design standpoint, including leading of Hebrew Quest Memrise and now Hebrew Grammar Quest This work is simply a compilation of many various first-year Hebrew resources, which he has knitted together to present in an original and engaging format For this reason, he likes to refer to himself as the designer or compiler of this dynamic Hebrew learning tool, and not the author of a static book Professionally, Chris has worked in the healthcare compliance field for over 30 years Personally, Chris is married and has two men in college. He and his wife, Sarah, love to travel, especially to Israel; (which, as you can tell, has inspired the format of each lesson in this book) Figure D.1: Chris Flanagan "],["license.html", "License", " License © 2020 Holy Language Institute.
