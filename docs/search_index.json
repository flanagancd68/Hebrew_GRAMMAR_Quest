The journey into the world of Biblical Hebrew grammar is a peek inside the mind of HaShem. By increased understanding of the Bible, we can better experience part of the culture of Bible authors such as Moses, David, and the prophets. With some narratives, reading them in Hebrew almost places us right there in the middle of the action. That’s pretty cool! Most importantly, learning the original language draws us closer to Yeshua and the world to which He ministered. It is for these reasons that we like to say this is not just a course, but a QUEST. Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is a journey into a deeper love your Bible and its primary Author. On the next few pages, we will tell you a little about our program and give you some preliminary action steps so you can get your gear in order before you begin your quest with Lesson 1. Let’s get started!

Our goal with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is to take the best attributes of a self-paced course and merge them with the best characteristics of a seminary-level Hebrew course, all in a way that reflects the heart of the Holy Language Institute! What you can expect from Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest: Academically CHALLENGING, but with a LOW-STRESS level Yeshua-centered with a primary emphasis on READING and UNDERSTANDING God’s Word We approach learning Biblical Hebrew from a devotional level, more than an academic one We use grammar rules, paradigms, and memorization as a means to achieve this goal Self-paced for independent learning but with mechanisms to provide FEEDBACK, ENCOURAGEMENT, and ways to CELEBRATE your ACCOMPLISHMENTS in the course Aligns with our Holy Language LEARNING PHILOSOPHY: emphasize active forms of learning over copious amounts of textbook reading and long lectures. You will complete various activities, including worksheets and Anki flashcards. COMPLIMENTS and INTEGRATES WITH Hebrew Quest Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is not a substitute for completing Hebrew Quest If you were to take a microscope to Hebrew Quest lessons 13-15 (the grammar lessons), Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is the result! See the Appendix FAQs for additional discussion on how Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest relate to one another The Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Guidebook is where you will get introduced to the material. Anki (along with the other activities) is where you will LEARN the material As you work through this course, set aside time to review Anki on a DAILY basis1 Anki is an open source flashcard application. All platforms are free, except for the iOS app, which costs $25. The developers use the proceeds to fund future development. Most reviews say the cost is worth it if you have Apple devices and use Anki regularly.↩︎ "],["more-information.html", "More information", " More information These articles are contained in the “About This Course” appendix.

Mounce states, “The fog means you will have read a chapter and think you understand it—and perhaps you do—but it will seem foggy. That’s okay. If living in the fog becomes discouraging, look two chapters back and you should understand that chapter clearly. In two more chapters the presently foggy chapter will be clear, assuming you keep studying.” At times, you can expect Foggy conditions on your quest. Here is an article on the subject you may find encouraging: Conquering the Fog.

Top to bottom: proto-Canaanite (~1600 BCE), paleo-Hebrew (~900 BCE), Rashi (1500 CE), Ketav Stam (used in Torah scrolls and other formal documents), contemporary block, and modern cursive. This course will use the contemporary block style. In this initial lesson, we will meet the Hebrew Aleph-Bet. The letters are like a family. Like a family, there can be unique dynamics (including not always playing nice with each other!). This lesson will take a look at some of those dynamics. LESSON ITINERARY Meet the Hebrew Aleph-Bet Understand that Hebrew is written and read from RIGHT to LEFT Identify subsets of letters: Five letters have final/Sofit forms Six letters take a Dagesh Lene Four letters are called “gutturals” (and one additional letter sometimes acts as a guttural) Ten letters sometimes behave differently Differentiate among “look-alike” letters Note differences between “Seminary” and “Sephardic” pronunciation If you are eager to jump right in with Lesson 1, we understand. We are also excited for you to start! “Equipment Check” is where we will pause before each lesson to make sure you have the right tools and supplies in your backpack before heading on the next phase of your Quest.

Both play a big factor in studying and understanding Hebrew grammar. Today, only three “BucK uP” letters - בּכּפּ - change pronunciation At one time, all six of these letters had different pronunciations, but today in Hebrew as spoken in Israel, only three do16 These are the letters in blue above בּ כּ פּ: ב has a “soft b” sound, in other words, a “v” sound, while בּ has a “hard b” sound, in other words, a “b” sound כ sounds like the “ch” in “bach”, while כּ is “k” as in “kangaroo” פ is the “ph” (or “f”) in “phone”, while פּ is the “p” in “pulley” Since the letters without the Dagesh Lene want to be “lazy” - for example, a weak ‘v’ instead of a strong ‘b’- our mnemonic for these is “BucK uP!

Academic/Seminary pronunciation is in red above, while Sephardic pronunciation is in blue. Modern pronunciation of the Tanakh, is based on Sephardic pronunciation; Hebrew Quest follows Sephardic pronunciation20 Consonants With “Seminary Hebrew,” all six בגד כפת letters take on a soft pronunciation, not just the three “BucK uP” letters The ג without the Dagesh Lene would receive something like the GH in “aGHast.” The ד and ת without the Dagesh Lene are closer to the English DH/TH like “this” Another difference between Sephardic and Seminary pronunciation is how to pronounce ו In academia, the consonant receives the “w” sound and is called “waw” (pronounced like the English “wow!”) In most non-academic circles, it receives the “v” sound and is pronounced “vav” This is important because a lot of the resources that we will reference come from academia and thus will have the “w” pronunciation. For example instead of “Imperfect vav-consecutive” (Lesson 17), we will frequently see “Imperfect waw-consecutive” Vowels There are also significant differences in pronouncing vowels, most notably the short a (“a” like “apple”; versus “ah” like “father”) There is also great variation in the names of the vowels, for example the A vowels are pronounced like PATHick and COMets in academia, and something like puhTOCK and kaMEYTZ (or even kaMATZ) outside of the classroom. We’ll have more to say about vowels in Lesson 2. The Covenant Name of God Lastly, since we are talking about pronunciation differences, will use “Adonai” or “the LORD” when we encounter the Covenant Name21 Again, in some of the materials that we have leveraged from academic circles, you may see (or hear) the Covenant Name (“Ya—h”) written out as this is common in those settings We are taking a devotional approach ”Seminary Hebrew” is a term borrowed from Dr. John Beckman. We don’t say ”Seminary Hebrew” to be disrespectful; we only mean to differentiate between the two pronunciation types.↩︎ There is also what is called Ashkenazi pronunciation, which is beyond the scope of this course. It also has some different pronunciations. Most notably, the letter ת is given an “s” sound at the end of a word, and “O” vowels are more prominent. So שׁבּת (shabbat), would be pronounced “Shabbos” in Ashkenazi.↩︎ Please read Izzy’s statement on the Covenant Name: “When I filmed Hebrew Quest I read God’s Hebrew name as”Yahweh”. This is a relatively common practice in academic circles and was also an expression of my personal love for God’s holy name. Since then though I’ve encountered conclusive evidence that Yeshua and his disciples followed the Jewish tradition of saying “Adonai” instead of using the Sacred Name. It’s my deep conviction that we should follow the example of Messiah and his apostles, so I’ve returned to saying “Adonai” (Hebrew for “the LORD”) or “HaShem” (Hebrew for “the Name”) instead of using the Sacred Name, and I encourage our students to do likewise.” ↩︎ "],["1.10-lesson-1-conclusion.html", "1.10 Lesson 1 Conclusion", " 1.10 Lesson 1 Conclusion Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Congratulations on completing the reading for the first lesson!

Vowels are what give a language its distinctive sound, and are what give words their meaning. Consider the simple English words “bay,” “boy,” and “buy.” These words have identical consonants but mean very different things because of the different vowels. It is the same with Hebrew. Above, you see Genesis 1:9. The black font shows the text with no vowels. This is how the Hebrew Bible was originally written. Over time, a group known as the Masorites developed the vowel notation we use today. These are the symbols in red. These are usually under, but sometimes in the middle of or over the affected consonant. This vowel system intends to preserve the pronunciation passed down for centuries via the oral tradition. The Hebrew name for these diacritical dots and dashes is nikudot which is the plural form of the word nikkud. The blue font shows additional cantillation marks, which synagogues use for chanting the verses. These marks also show where the word’s accent is. We will talk more about Cantillation marks in Unit 3.

In the next lesson, we will learn about an exception to the “vowel comes after” rule, called the furtive patach.↩︎ See discussion in Lesson 1 on the differences between academic pronunication and that which we might hear from a native speaker. “Basics of Biblical Hebrew” labels the first vowel “Qamets” and pronounced either qa-MAYTZ or QA-maytz. Others, including Dr. Beckman, spell the vowel as “Qamats” and pronounced qa-MAHTZ (or sometimes or QA-mahtz, which sounds like the English word comets). The short A, Patach has similar variation (some say “PATH-ac”, others, “Pa-TOCK”). For whatever reason, the pronunciation of the names of the vowels is not standardized, nor is this a point to be overly concerned about. For simplicity, students may choose to use Izzy’s pronunciation in Hebrew Quest.

Vowel letters commonly take “defective” forms33 Holem-Vav can drop the Vav and contract to Holem, as in the example above Hireq-Yod can drop the Yod and contract to Hireq Shuruq can drop entirely and contract to Qibbuts - this sometimes catches students by surprise - see caution box below. The Qamets-Hei ה ָ sometimes drops the final ה, leaving just the Qamets under the now-final letter.

As we progress in the course, you will see this in action. If any of this is confusing now, as we’ve said before, hang in there! As you progress in your knowledge of Hebrew, you’ll start to develop a mental checklist when you encounter something that does not seem to follow the regular rules.

Understanding accents and vowel and syllable preferences helps to unlock God’s Word On top of the lesson content itself, we also are introducing two new activities that correspond with the official launch of Vocabulary and Study Verses you will see in Anki. We understand if after reading this lesson then doing the Anki work (perhaps repeated a few times), you still aren’t getting it. The Fog isn’t clearing. This is completely normal. Keep at it, or take a break and resume later. If you want a more in-depth lecture covering this material, we recommend Dr. John Beckman’s hour-long YouTube Lecture on lesson 3.

Also, שַׁדַּי is another name for God. It means “Almighty.” Find two examples of this name. (Blue) In verse 16, highlight, “עַמֵּךְ עַמִּי וֵאלֹהַיִךְ אֱלֹהָי” in green. This is the famous verse, “your people (will be) my people, and your God, my God.” One of your vocabulary words is אֱלֹהִים. In the last two words of what you just highlighted, you can still see the core portion of אֱלֹהִים present. Begin to notice how Hebrew uses different suffixes to denote “your” and “my.” In verse 1, find one Sheva that begins a word and one Sheva that concludes a word. (Yellow). Which one is a silent Sheva, and which one is the vocal Sheva? Find the Quiescent Aleph in verse 1 (pink) Find the Hebrew words for Elimelech, Machlon, Chilion, and Judah in verses 1-7. Chilion has the prefix “וְ” which means “and.” These names appear two times each. (grey) For personal reflection, open an English translation side-by-side with your Hebrew version of Ruth 1. Note how the foreigner Ruth uses both אֱלֹהִים and the Tetragrammaton in verses 16 and 17, respectively. Why do you think this might be? Would you say the names are used interchangeably, or do you think there is a deeper purpose? May we always seek HIM, just as you have done in this activity!

As you advance in Hebrew, you will enjoy seeing how the Bible authors employ the Vav at the beginning of a sentence or clause to evoke different meanings For example, when added to a verb, it usually serves to continue or advance the narrative When added to a non-verb, it is often those stage directions we mentioned: a contrast, a scene shift, or a parenthetical comment It’s safe to say, there is a LOT packed in to this little letter ו! TRANSLATION TIPS As you are starting out in Hebrew, go ahead and start your translation of the Vav Conjunction with “And”, but remember to be flexible Another word, such as “but” or “then” might make more sense depending on the context of the passage Many times for smooth English, we will need to leave the Vav untranslated "],["5.4-vav_identify.html", "5.4 Identify the Vav Conjunction", " 5.4 Identify the Vav Conjunction Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x The Vav conjunction is usually וְ prefixed to a word You will see וּ before במפ - remember “BuMP”- this is the ONLY time a vowel will ever begin a syllable The ב and פ will lose their Dagesh Lene It’s בֵּן, (between), but it’s וּבֵן (and between) The conjunction will also be וּ before a consonant that has a Sheva You may see וָ before some accented syllables (remember the Vowel-Syllable preferences) Since Vav takes a Vocal Sheva, the Rule of Sheva applies when וְ is prefixed to a word beginning with a reduced vowel (Vocal Sheva or Hateph vowel) How to tell the difference between the conjunction and words that start with ו?

Sometimes there is no change to the preceding vowel - this is called “virtual doubling.” As Dr. Van Pelt, the co-author of Basics of Biblical Hebrew likes to say ““Virtual Doubling” should be called “virtually no doubling”, because no spelling changes occur.” When SQiN eM LeVY consonants reject the Dagesh, there is NEVER compensatory lengthening.

We will use the paradigm word טוֹב to illustrate An adjective is either masculine or feminine An adjective is either singular or plural (dual nouns take plural adjectives) An adjective will match the gender and number of the noun that it modifies or for which it substitutes This is a big difference from nouns, which can change number but never gender Note that for irregular nouns, the adjective will not necessarily match the exact ending נָשִׁים טוֹבוֹת - even though “נָשִׁים” has the irregular -im ending, the adjective טוֹבוֹת remains the regular feminine plural An adjective will use expected gender and number endings as shown in the graphic above The Lexical Form of an adjective is the MS The MS form is usually endingless The MS can be Seghol+Hei as in יָפֶה, which is MS for pleasing, beautiful.

The main challenge with a pronoun is determining the noun it replaces. See what happened there? We used the pronoun “it”. You probably deduced “it” was referring to the word “pronoun,” not “noun.” That is because you are very familiar with English context and syntax. The example, “John saw Bob. He said, ‘hello’” is ambiguous; we are not sure what the author meant to convey The example “John saw Sally. He said, ‘hello’” is not ambiguous at all Hebrew works very similarly As such, this is an important topic that will take two lessons (8 and 9). A firm grasp of pronouns helps us to decipher what is happening in the narrative.

In Lesson 6, we learned about one-letter preposition prefixes to words. Pronominal suffixes work similarly. The difference is these go on the back of words instead of the front. On a noun, a pronominal suffix indicates the one who owns or is related to the noun: His books / her houses / their house / our father As this indicates a specific noun (in other words, not just any books, but HIS books), a noun with a pronominal suffix is DEFINITE This is our third of four factors that make a Hebrew noun definite80: Has the (definite) article Is a proper name Has a pronominal suffix On a preposition, the suffix indicates the object: to her / with them / behind him / in front of it Verbs also take pronominal suffixes, which will indicate the verb’s object.

The steps for a Type 1 suffix are on this page, and the steps for Type 2 are in the next section. Remove the pronominal suffix With שִׁיר, we are done at step 1 Remembering that type one suffixes can only go with SINGULAR nouns, the next step is to fix the singular ending as needed If the remaining word has a word-final ת, it is likely feminine.

You might be surprised to learn that you are already familiar with at least one Hebrew Construct chain. בֵּית לֶחֶם, the word you probably know as “Bethlehem”, literally means “house of bread” and is a Hebrew construct chain. The first thing you might notice is that בַּ֫יִת, the word for “house”, is spelled a little differently. The reason for this is that בֵּית is in what we call a “construct” form or state. בַּ֫יִת means “house”, and is said to be in “absolute” form בֵּית means “house of”, and is said to be in “construct” form In this lesson, we will discuss the parameters of a Hebrew construct chain. Keep in mind that we do not need to spell the construct state for a given noun. Our primary goal is to recognize it and translate it adequately when we read our Bibles. LESSON ITINERARY Describe what is meant by the term “construct chain” Define a Hebrew construct chain Review and identify what makes a word definite Determine the definiteness of a chain Differentiate between absolute state and construct state words EQUIPMENT CHECK Before continuing, can you describe the following concepts?

The first important thing to know about a Hebrew construct chain is this: The very last noun in the chain is said to be in the “absolute state”. All words in the chain before the absolute noun are said to be in “construct state.” בֵּית לֶחֶם, “house of bread” “bread” would be in the absolute state “house of” is in the construct state The entire phrase would be called a “construct chain” A construct chain has one and only one absolute noun and one or more construct nouns In English, we would typically add the word “of” after each word in the construct state. We could say “the king’s son” or the “son of the king,” and both would mean the same thing Translating a construct word as “of” is a starting point and not a hard-and-fast requirement Just like we may add 's, Hebrew has different spelling for nouns in construct The absolute noun is the “normal” spelling and meaning "],["10.2-a-construct-chain-describes-the-first-noun-in-the-chain.html", "10.2 A Construct Chain describes the FIRST noun in the chain", " 10.2 A Construct Chain describes the FIRST noun in the chain Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Figure 10.3: A construct chain describes the first NOUN in the chain. The purpose of the chain is to describe the first noun in the chain, but not necessarily the first word in the chain After the the previous discussion, it might be reasonable to think that the construct chain would be describing the noun in the absolute state, but that is not usually the case In בֵּית לֶחֶם, we are describing the house, not the bread If there were a substantival adjective as the first word, e.g., חַכְמֵי־לֵב, “wise of heart”, the chain is describing “heart,” not “wise” "],["10.3-words-in-construct-will-not-have-the-article-or-any-adjectives.html", "10.3 Words in Construct will not have the Article or any adjectives", " 10.3 Words in Construct will not have the Article or any adjectives Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Nothing else can come between words in construct - this can pose translation challenges so watch word endings carefully In English, we could add an adjective like “the servant of the wicked son of the king” In Hebrew, any adjectives must come after the whole chain A literal translation would look like: “servant of son of the king the wicked” To resolve, we would need to go back and determine which word the adjective modifies by matching the gender and number Translating is straightforward when the nouns in the construct chain are of a mixed number or gender For example: “the wife of David the strong the smart, the beautiful” If “strong” and “beautiful” were FS, then we know they are referring to David’s wife If “smart” was MS, we know it is referring to David The sentence translation would be clear: “The strong and beautiful wife of smart David” See examples below using “good”, “king” and “land”. Note how the gender and number of the adjective tells us which noun it is modifying Figure 10.4: In many cases, the gender and number of a trailing adjective can indicate which word it modifies When an adjective has the same gender and number as two or more nouns in the construct chain, there is potential ambugity as to which word the adjective is modifying We must rely on context In the example of “servant of son of the king the wicked” there is ambiguity84 All nouns are masculine singular, so the adjective is masculine singular See example animation below Note that this is a hypothetical example used to illustrate the potential ambiguity Most of the time, translating a construct chain with an adjective is straightforward Often there is no ambiguity When there is, the context of the passage would indicate which man was the wicked one Figure 10.5: Because adjectives do not appear next to construct nouns, it can sometimes be a challenge to determine which word the adjective modifies.

When you read from a Tanach, you are much more likely to encounter the complete set of Hebrew accent marks Becoming more comfortable with the Hebrew Bible includes having a basic familiarity with these additional marks Things to keep in mind: There are over 20 different cantillation marks We won’t go into what each one means, but there are plenty of resources on the Internet if you are interested in digging deeper Most often, there is only one cantillation mark per word - where you see the mark is where the accent goes Occasionally, you will see a mark near the front or middle of the word, as well as a mark near the end of a word The first mark is a secondary accent Remember, a primary Hebrew accent can ONLY be on the LAST or SECOND-TO-LAST syllable The vertical line | that can appear between two words can be ignored When in doubt, listen to Izzy’s audio carefully as he reads each verse to determine where the accent goes Trying to read with these marks can be visually distracting and overwhelming at first With practice, you will get used to them Cantillation marks are part of the rich tradition of Biblical Hebrew passed down to us from many centuries ago Many cantillation marks look like a vowel in the wrong place If you see a mark that is not a vowel you recognize (such as an upside-down wishbone) or in the wrong place (such as a dot directly above a consonant instead of the upper-left, inside or below) it is a cantillation mark. You already know your vowels, so don’t let these marks trick you! Pausal Forms The above marks are called “major accents” The Silluq looks like a Metheg but isn’t; it is found at the end of a verse The athnach divides a verse in half the zaqueph qatan divides a half-verse In some respects, they are similar to the English period, semi-colon, or comma In fact, when translating, we will usually want to put a period or comma whenever we see one of these accents In Lesson 3, we briefly mentioned “pausal forms” The above accents may cause Pausal forms, and Pausal Forms may change the spelling A Patach, Seghol, or sheva may change to Qamets Example קָטַל becomes קָטָל A sheva may change to a Seghol in the 2ms pronominal suffix (Lesson 19) סוּסְךָ to סוּסֶ֫ךָ Words that are normally accented on the ultima may undergo an accent shift to the penultima with resulting vowel change, for example אֲנִי can become אָ֫נִי If you see an unexpected vowel, especially a Qamets, look for one of these accents. You may have encountered a pausal form.

Now that we have concluded our discussion on nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and prepositions, we will now focus on verbs. Around 70% of Hebrew verbs are in what we call the Qal stem, so we will spend Lessons 13-22 (in other words, Unit III) learning that stem inside and out. Qal verbs represent “simple action”, or active voice with a simple unnuanced type of action.91 Our quest is to translate accurately. To do this, we must identify the root, stem, conjugation, person, gender, and number of verbs. This lesson will provide a detailed introduction to the verb system as a whole and some general conventions. You might notice there are a lot of sections in this lesson. Most of these tend to be short introductions. “Hebrew verbs, meet student. Student, this are Hebrew verbs.” Frequently, we will take a concept you already learned in Units I and II, then modify it slightly to apply it to verbs.

In these times, we must depend on God to sustain us. It is times like these where God can pour into us and prepare us for our next adventure. Moses, Elijah, John the Immerser, and several others all had their time in the Wilderness that God used to mold them as servant-leaders.

It is a verb that frequently occurs in the Hebrew Bible. In לֹא־שָׁמְרוּ, the word לֹא serves to negate the verb it precedes. Literally, this might be “not they kept”, but we would say “they did not keep” in English. Every day, and frequently throughout each day, we have two choices. We can keep His word, or we can ignore His word. Let us strive to have it be told of all of us, שָׁמְרוּ אֶת־דְּבַר יְהוָה , “they KEPT the word of Adonai.” Figure 13.1: Mt Gerezim, Shechem, Mt. Ebal from east. In Deuteronomy 11, Moses instructs that when Israel enters the land, she is to read the blessings from Mt. Gerezim and the curses from not following His word from Mt. Ebal. Today, Shechem is also known as the Arab city of Nablus.

As we get into Unit 4, this formula (in combination with the \\(Pre\\) pattern) will save you hours of paradigm memorization of the derived stems You will only need to memorize the Qal paradigms, then apply this formula to the other stems So let’s start to build this formula for the Qal: \\[V_{S} = A \\sim\\] In the formula, \\(A\\) refers to Patach This formula is telling you that the Stem Vowel of the Perfect Conjugation prefers Patach P3FS and P3CP will be exceptions in all stems Pronominal suffixes (Lesson 19) will also cause deviations The Imperfect Stem Vowel will be to the right of the \\(\\sim\\) mark - we’ll address this in Lesson 15 "],["13.12-step-5-v_s-is-accented-in-finite-verbs.html", "13.12 Step 5: \\(V_S\\) is accented in Finite verbs", " 13.12 Step 5: \\(V_S\\) is accented in Finite verbs Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x As we introduced in Lesson 12, verbs that have “person” designation are called Finite verbs Perfect, Imperfect, Imperative, Cohortative, Jussive are FINITE Infinitive Construct, Infinitive Absolute, Participle are NON-FINITE because they do not have “person” The \\(V_S\\) is accented in Finite verbs, when possible As we said in the previous lesson, \\(V_S\\) usually = \\(V_2\\)102 Take a look at this table again and note where the accent lands Exceptions: 3FS and 3CP - a Sheva/reduced vowel is NEVER accented 2MS and 2FP - The “heavy sufformatives” will draw the accent like a magnet EXCEPTIONS When \\(V_S\\) is a Sheva or Hateph vowel: Sheva/reduced vowels never take an accent In the Perfect, we will see this in QP3fs and QP3cp When the verb has a “heavy sufformative” A heavy sufformative takes the accent There are two heavy sufformatives in Hebrew: 2mp - תֶּ֫ם and 2fp - תֶּ֫ן When the verb has a pronominal suffix (Lesson 19) When \\(V_S\\) is not one of the final two syllables Exceptions, particulalry with biconsonantal/hollow verbs will be discussed in the weak verb sections)↩︎ "],["13.13-step-6-v_1-bar-a-qamets-in-the-qal-perfect-strong-paradigm.html", "13.13 Step 6: \\(V_1 = \\bar A\\) (Qamets) in the Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm", " 13.13 Step 6: \\(V_1 = \\bar A\\) (Qamets) in the Qal Perfect Strong Paradigm Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x The Qamets is wonderfully consistent in the Qal Perfect!

To understand Biblical Hebrew, we must be able to translate weak verbs. A weak verb is defined as a verb with one or more letters that cause the word to deviate from the strong verb pattern. We already looked at two of these in the previous lesson: נ and ת assimilate under certain conditions. Many Hebrew grammar textbooks asked students to memorize all of the differences in each stem and conjugation. Fortunately, there is an easier way. We can simply study the changes caused by weak letters. These changes then become clues we can use to uncover the applicable strong verb pattern. This will enable us to correctly determine a weak verb’s stem and conjugation to translate it accurately.

They took the easy path, which caused tension between the tribes. Students of history know that these lands to the east were often easily invaded.

Her father quickly replied, “God loves you so much, He can’t take His eyes off you.” Let that sink in as you study Biblical Hebrew. Figure 15.1: Ascent of Adummim Roman road remains. This was the main route from Jericho to Jerusalem in antiquity. It was notoriously treacherous, both in terms of physical exertion, rising 3500 feet in just 15 miles, as well as in terms of physical safety.

The Imperfect is extremely common and it is the foundation for other conjugations such as the volitional and the Waw-Imperfect. Once you get comfortable with this chapter’s content, the rest of the course WILL get easier. Our goal was to give you enough of an overview to get you started on the Anki exercises. Take your time working through Anki, and be sure you keep up with your reviews each day. What may seem foggy now will begin to make sense soon! If, as you do the exercises, things just are not clicking into place, we can recommend Dr. Beckman’s lecture on Basics of Biblical Hebrew Chapter 16. Note that it is over two-hours in length, so it is very thorough. Apart from a few irregular changes, the Qal Imperfect is relatively easy to recognize with the distinctive preformatives. We just need to remember the changes weak letters cause and work our way back to the strong paradigm.

Way back from Lesson 2 of Hebrew Quest, there was a vocabulary word that illustrates the Vav Consecutive: וּכְתְַבְתָּם. The initial ו means “and”, so we might want to say that this word simply means “and you wrote them.” In Hebrew, the Vav Consecutive also has a grammatical purpose of changing the verb’s meaning from Perfect to Imperfect. This is true even though it is affixed to a Perfect verb, כָּתַבְתָּ means “you (ms) wrote them” (perfect), but putting a ו as prefix changes the meaning to “and you will write them” (imperfect). The opposite happens when the Vav Consecutive is affixed to an Imperfect verb: the resulting word is Perfect (past tense). Less frequently, there are times with the Vav is just a Vav and is not acting as a Consecutive. We’ll learn more about these changes in this Lesson. The terminology on this topic is a bit fluid. The term “Waw Consecutive” is significantly more prevalent than “Vav Consecutive” in academic circles, so we will still encounter the “w” references frequently in Hebrew grammar materials.

Later in this lesson, we will study Genesis 1:1-5 from Hebrew Quest. Verse 2 begins with the conjunction prefixed to a noun, while verses 3-5 begin with the “Vav Consecutive”, which is to say the letter Vav is prefixed to a verb.

Lesson 18 marks the start of the second semester of a traditional first-year Hebrew Course. In other words, congratulations! You are halfway through the course! Many students believe the second half of the course is easier than the first half. This is because the foundational work is behind us; reading the Bible, while not yet fluid, is definitely becoming more enjoyable. We have covered the two primary uses of the Qal stem: the Perfect and Imperfect (including the Waw-Consecutive). For the remainder of Unit 3, we will round out our study of Qal Verbs with the Volitional forms (Lesson 18), the Infinitive forms (Lessons 20 and 21), and the Participle forms (Lesson 22).

To understand Biblical Hebrew, we must have an understanding of how suffixes are used with verbs. Instead of learning something entirely new, Lesson 19 will be one where we take a concept you already know and apply it to a new scenario. The verbal pronominal suffixes are the same suffixes we learned from Lesson 9. In fact, verbs ONLY use the “Type 1” suffixes. The more challenging aspects can include significant spelling and accent changes. This can result in words that are identically spelled but have different meanings. One of the first vocabulary words in Hebrew Quest was וּכְתְַבְתָּם. We mentioned in Lesson 17 how this word has the Vav Consecutive (AND you will WRITE them). It also has a 3mp pronominal suffix (and you will write THEM). In Lesson 19, we will explore these pronominal suffixes from Lesson 9 and apply them to verbs.

(Psalms 17:6) Imagine walking along a path like the one pictured below on a day Yeshua taught in this same area. What would you be thinking and feeling? Would you be giddy, as if if you got special access to a famous entertainer or dignitary? Would you try to get His autograph or a “selfie” with Him? Would you be skeptical, wondering whether this man named Yeshua you have heard about is really “all that”? In the back of your mind, would you even be questioning whether He is a fraud? Would He be just another voice with a platform like all the people with thousands of followers on YouTube today? Or, would you know there is something special about Him? Would you have realized that Yeshua is God, come to bridge the divide between you and the Father? Be honest. Meditate on that as you work through this lesson, and as you study the “Avinu” in this lesson’s Hebrew Quest Study Passage. Figure 19.1: Mount of Beatitudes path through an olive grove.

Do we follow in HIS ways, or do we continue in OUR ways? In our Hebrew Quest Study Passage for this lesson, we will read the story of when Adonai commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.

The LORD kept his promises to keep Israel when the nation was in Egypt. This Lesson’s grammar subject is the Infinitive Absolute. In Hebrew, the Infinitive Absolute is often used to emphasize another verb. When this happens, the verb being emphasized will be repeated, but in the Infinitive Absolute form. In, אַעַלְךָ גַם־עָלֹה, the literal translation might be, “I will bring you up again bringing up.” The meaning of the phrase is, “I will SURELY bring you up again,” as if to say, “Don’t worry! I am definitely bringing up out of Egypt. In fact, there is zero chance I will not bring you up!” This is an excellent picture of what the LORD means when He says He will “keep” us! Figure 21.1: Ketef Hinnom with archeologist Gabriel Barkay. In 1979, Barkay’s team found two tiny silver scrolls, inscribed with portions of the Priestly Blessing from Numbers 6 and apparently once used as amulets, in this burial chamber in Jerusalem.

(Psalms 9:11) Our Hebrew Quest study passage for this lesson is Matthew 13 and the parable of the sower. Yeshua clarifies that the “good soil” is someone who hears the word, understands it, and then does something with it. In contrast, the soil among the thorns is someone who hears the word but doesn’t fully trust in Adonai or his promises. We see one of these promises in Psalms 9:11. It’s become a cliche for Bible teachers to ask, “which of the four soils are you?” In truth, for most of us, our lives at some point have reflected each of four soils. So the better question to ask might be: “Today, in the next 1440 minutes, how can I make sure that I am the ‘good soil’, trusting in Adonai, and producing a yield for the Kingdom?” Figure 22.1: Cove of the Sower from the east. This is the suggested location of Yeshua’s teaching we call ‘The Parable of the Sower’ (Matthew 13). This region’s acoustic properties have been analyzed. Scientists found that a person could be in a boat a few feet from the shore and easily be heard without amplification by ‘large crowds’ scattered several hundred feet up the embankment.

communicates to us. With this knowledge, we can begin to think critically in our evaluation of differences in translation and the validity of arguments we read in commentaries. We will cover a lot of Scripture in this lesson. For this reason, this lesson, including the Anki exercises, will be a bit longer than usual as you store these verses in your heart. It was a great move for the authors of Basics of Biblical Hebrew to include this lesson. Often, Hebrew syntax and meaning is reserved for second year/intermediate Hebrew. This lesson won’t cover all we’ll ever need to know but it will get us well on our way to a deeper understanding of Scripture and a deeper relationship with Yeshua. We’re excited for you to begin this lesson. Let’s get to it! LESSON ITINERARY Understand the significance of word order upon translation Describe the nuances of translation based upon word order and whether or not a verb has the ו prefix Translate conditional and volitional phrases EQUIPMENT CHECK Before continuing, make sure you have an understanding of the Qal conjugations.

A literal reading of this verse might be, “now I know that great is Adonai from all the gods.” מִן changes this to a comparative or even a superlative use. Comparative would be, “Our God is GREATER THAN all the other gods.” A superlative translation might be, “out of all the gods, I know Adonai is THE GREATEST.” This lesson will provide some overarching tips on interpretation and translation based on what we have studied so far.

This is a Vav that is prefixed to a verb and serves to link the narrative and move it forward in some fashion. When a Vav is prefixed to a non-verb, it is called a DISjunctive Vav. As the name implies, it indicates some kind of break or tangent in the narrative. There are four primary ways a disjunctive Vav is used, as illustrated by the verses below. Parenthetical use: וְהֵם וְהֵם לֹא יָדְעוּ כִּי שֹׁמֵעַ יוֹסֵף כִּי הַמֵּלִיץ בֵּינֹתָם (Now) They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them (Gen 42:23) Your browser does not support the audio element.

Note how the main narrative does not continue but pauses to let us know the names of the people involved. This is providing supplemental background information. The Conjunctive Vav in Ruth 1:7 serves to begin a more detailed, focused narrative account of Naomi’s return Note how the Disjunctive Vav in the final clause of 1:14 - Vav + non-verb (subject) + predicate - introduces a CONTRAST of Ruth’s attitude of clinging, signaling deep loyalty and attachment to Naomi (see the דבק + בְּ note in Lesson 13 answer key), compared to Orpah’s goodbye kiss In 1:16, כִּי introduces a subordinate clause that has an explanatory function. “Ruth tells Naomi to stop urging her to go back because she has determined that she will follow Naomi wherever her mother-in-law goes.”137 1:17 has what some scholars refer to as an “oath formula”. כֹּה gives the punishment for breaking the promise, and כִּי gives the condition. The specifics appear to be implied rather than stated. This makes a literal translation awkward. At the same time, any other translation becomes somewhat speculative and dependent on what the translator believes is the context. NET renders the first clause as “The LORD will punish me severely.” Other oaths of this type appear in 1 Samuel 14:44, 1 Samuel 20:13, 2 Samuel 3:9, 1 Kings 2:23, and 1 Kings 19:2 In 1:20, כִּי introduces a subordinate clause that has an explanatory function. Naomi is elaborating on why she wants a new name. We have noted that most Hebrew clauses begin with a verb, but 1:21 begins with “I”. Naomi is drawing attention to her condition: full when she left, but now returning empty. Curiously, Ruth evidently counts for nothing. Naomi’s attitude will definitely change by the end of the book! Also, note in 1:21 the Disjunctive Vav clauses, “And Adonai” followed by “And Shaddai.” Chisholm notes that the use may be “semi-poetic”: “Adonai has testified about me; Shaddai has afflicted me”138. Finally, the Iwc in 1:22 begins a summarizing, concluding statement bringing the “first act” of the drama to a close.

You now have the hardest work of a first-year Hebrew grammar course behind you. From here on out, we will be studying the six major derived Hebrew Verb stems Niphal, Piel, Pual, Hiphil, Hophal, and Hitpael. The reason we spent so much time on the Qal stem is not only because it’s the most frequently occurring stem, but everything from this point forward is based on what you learned in Unit III. This means, for the most part, the lessons that follow will be shorter and much more methodical. If you remember our introduction to Unit III, we drew the comparison to a math formula. If we know \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), we do not need to memorize the dimensions of every triangle (assuming that were possible). Instead, we can take the metaphorical triangle in front of us and use the formula to get what we need. In Unit III, you learned all the formulas. Unit IV will merely present you with “triangles” of different sizes. Summaries of each of the derived stems will consist of the overall diagnostic features. It is THESE features that should be memorized, not the numerous paradigms. Now is the time to download the current Unit IV Anki deck if you haven’t already done so!

The Piel is also easily distinguished from the Hitpael, which has a unique prefix.

However, if we are not already keeping His words, worshiping and serving Him, and serving others in our native language, then nothing about learning Hebrew by itself will transform our lives. We must practice the disciplines of worship, service, and study (and teaching if that is our calling) so that these traits become hard-wired habits. If that is already in place then we can use Hebrew to reach new depths in our relationships. Figure 26.1: Man with arms upraised at Western Wall.

In that sense, you will now be wading a little deeper into the Hebrew pool! We’re going to do this in small chunks over the next several lessons. If Ruth 1 is “Act 1” of the drama, we’ll start with what is “scene 1”: Ruth 1:1-6. YOUR QUEST Read Ruth 1:1-6 in the Hebrew text and underline any words or forms do you not recognize For the first time, try doing this without any study aids, including your Ruth Pursuit Translation Worksheet Then as needed, look up the words you don’t recognize Using what you have learned about syntax/phrase constructions and context, compose your own interpretative translation (this time, using your Ruth worksheet and whatever other resources you’d like!) You may wish to compose a structural outline of “mini-scenes” identified by conjunctive or disjunctive clauses, quotations, or other constructions Compare your version with translations of your choice. These may include JPS, KJV, ESV, NASB, NIV, or NLT.141 At what points do you agree and disagree with translation decisions made by these publications? This exercise is for you. Although you will need to complete this activity in order to earn your diploma, you will not have to turn this in, and it will not be graded as a part of this course.

We realize it’s a long road that you have traveled, yet at this stage, it might seem like you still have a long ways to go before reaching your destination. Be of good cheer and do not lose heart! God is working within you through these lessons! Throughout your life, you have likely had many journeys and many destinations. Each lesson you finish and each day you complete your Anki reviews is a small destination: an arrival of sorts that should be celebrated. Many people who travel to Israel rightly look back on Jerusalem as the pinnacle of their trip. And in a sense, many “first-timer” tours are structured so that Jerusalem is the “grand finale”. However, if those tourists were focused ONLY on getting to Jerusalem, they could miss the blessings of the many other places they visited and the lessons learned along the way. You are nearing the end of your journey! Keep focusing on Him! Make sure each day you are entering into His presence with thanksgiving and praise!

The passage’s geographic detail reminds us that the events involved real people and real places. This is true even though these events took place thousands of years ago and thousands of miles away. HaShem had these details recorded for a reason. Through our study of Hebrew, we can connect with these great stories in a more intimate way. Praise Him for that!

(Isaiah 24:12) As people of God, we are sometimes faced with situations where we are tempted to ask, “How could He let this happen?” The people of Isaiah’s time who witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem indeed had similar questions. Most of the time, we can not provide a satisfactory answer. The only right choice is to relinquish any notion that we can control the situation and, like Job, trust in Him no matter what the outcome.

It is said to be the closest spot one can get to the Holy of Holies. While this wall was built in King Herod’s time (well after Hezekiah), modern Jews and God-fearing gentiles consider it an honor to be able to follow in the tradition of Hezekiah and pray at the wall. Many of us may be physically removed from Jerusalem and the Western Wall. Like Daniel who was also hundreds of miles away, we can still turn towards Jerusalem and bring our petitions to HaShem just as Hezekiah did centuries ago. Why don’t you stop what you’re doing and pray towards Jerusalem right now? Figure 34.1: Men Praying at Western Wall.

Where you can go next: Continue to grow your vocabulary, both by isolated word memorization, such as by learning the top 1000 (or more) Biblical Hebrew words and, of course, by continuing to read your Hebrew Bible. For word memorization, there are modules on Memrise and Anki that are free (these are not affiliated with Holy Language Institute) Bible Verses What you have accomplished: Translated around 500 Bible verses in Hebrew (many more verses if you did the Hebrew Quest Study Passages), including many grammatically challenging concepts Where you can go next: * Grab a Tanach and a study guide and dig in! * If you haven’t already done so, check out Dr. Beckman’s lecture on How to prepare a passage Ruth Pursuit What you have accomplished: You have skimmed, if not read entirely through, Ruth Chapter one at least 30 times. The Ruth Pursuit Analysis was your introduction to intermediate Hebrew, where you took the first-year grammar concepts and applied them to a passage of Scripture to compose your own translation. Where you can go next: INTERMEDIATE HEBREW! You can review Dr. Beckman’s Notes on Ruth We can recommend two Intermediate Hebrew books: A Workbook for Intermediate Hebrew, by Robert B. Chisholm, Jr., which contains a verse by verse expositional grammar study through the books of Ruth and Jonah The same author has From Exegesis to Exposition: A Practical Guide to Using Biblical Hebrew Hebrew Quest Study Passages (“Honors” track) What you have accomplished: You have studied 20 distinct passages, most of which were full chapters of the Hebrew Bible or passages from the Delitsch Hebrew New Testament. You have also completed the 17-lesson “Premium Proverbs” study. Where you can go next: After Hebrew Quest, review Izzy’s Hebrew Verses studies. Hebrew Verses picks up where Hebrew Quest left off.

Read on to see what “Following Yeshua, in a Hebrew way, together” means to us. Following Yeshua When the first disciples heard “follow me”, they understood they were being invited into a relationship with this Rabbi from Nazareth. Through this journey of discipleship, they would become like him and go on to change the world with him. They knew that following Yeshua was all about knowing Yeshua. That’s what our learning experiences are all about. In a Hebrew Way The disciples of Jesus joined him in reading the Hebrew Bible and praying the Hebrew prayers. That’s why this isn’t just a language - it’s a way of following in the footsteps of the Master, a way of encountering the King of the Jews through the language of his people. Together The men and women who followed Yeshua became a safe and loving community. Same with us! As an organization, we’re Holy Language “Institute”. As a community of disciples, we’re the Holy Language “Tribe”. Together we’re a movement, making disciples and changing the world.

Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x If you are familiar with our ministry, you know our flagship course Hebrew Quest, which introduces our students to Yeshua and our Jewish Bible. Hebrew Quest was designed to get students into the Hebrew text as quickly as possible, with minimal focus on learning rules. For many of our students, this approach is quite successful. We noticed that many other students started to drop off between lessons 12 and 16, after the Aleph-Bet lectures. For some students, these lessons were too much Hebrew grammar too fast, and for others, it was not enough Hebrew grammar. As a result, several of our students have asked us for a grammar resource to supplement Hebrew Quest. As we searched for a resource to recommend to these students, we noticed that they tended to fall into one of two camps: A workbook or a series of videos that are entirely self-paced/self-directed Academic/Seminary level textbooks and courses These two are often opposite extremes. Self-paced courses can have too little structure and often provide only a superficial review of Hebrew. In the end, the student may only be slightly more prepared to read the Hebrew Bible than if they had not done the course. There are also limited feedback opportunities as these courses are designed for independent learning. On the other hand, seminary courses and seminary-level textbooks are usually incredibly rigorous with copious amounts of reading, rote memorization of paradigms, lectures, and exams. Academic courses are fast-paced and high-stress 150. Seminary textbooks generally are much more detailed and advanced than most of our students need (or would enjoy)151 Additionally, with either option, our Holy Language students would incur additional fees to purchase these materials. Many of the resources we researched are top-notch. Depending on a student’s goals, we would not hesitate to recommend them. It’s just that they were not quite what we were seeking for the majority of our students. See the next section to learn how Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is distinct. For example, in a seminary course, the 36 lessons in Basics of Biblical Hebrew are usually completed in 16 weeks.↩︎ For example, there is usually an emphasis on writing Hebrew and conducting English-to-Hebrew translations. While these may be important skills to become fluent in Hebrew, one does not need these skills to read and understand the Bible, especially from a spiritual or devotional perspective.↩︎ "],["hgq_and_hq.html", "What is the Relationship to Hebrew Quest?", " What is the Relationship to Hebrew Quest? Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x We’ve said that Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest does not replace Hebrew Quest. Instead, we believe Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest supports and extends Hebrew Quest. In fact, one way to think of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest could be as “Hebrew Quest: Extended Edition”! Suppose you were to take a hypothetical microscope and inspect Lessons 12-15 of Hebrew Quest. These are the lessons where Izzy reviews Vowels, Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, and other grammar topics. Under that microscope, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is what you would see. Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest will start with a brief review of the Aleph-bet and the vowels we learned in Hebrew Quest Lessons 1-12 Then we begin our deep dive into core grammar topics touched upon in Hebrew Quest Lessons 13-15 Additionally, starting with Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest Lesson 12, students can elect to complete a “Hebrew Quest Study Passage Track” Primary geared for students who have not yet completed all of Hebrew Quest, this will incorporate the Proverbs study and the Bible reading sections from Hebrew Quest Students will read through the passage and compose a translation They will then watch Izzy’s Hebrew Quest teaching video explaining the passage Students who complete all of the Hebrew Quest Study Passage Tracks will receive extra special recognition upon completion of the course.

Your browser does not support the audio element. 2.5x 2x 1.5x 1x .75x .5x Emphatically NO! If you have finished Hebrew Quest, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest might be a logical next step to go deeper. On the other hand, maybe you started Hebrew Quest but hit some roadblocks. In that case, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest can provide you with important underlying grammatical concepts so, eventually, you can return to Hebrew Quest and finish up. It’s important to know that Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is an extension of Hebrew Quest, not a substitute. As a best-case, we recommend you complete Hebrew Quest Lessons 1-12 before starting Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest. So, if you haven’t started either course, go ahead and start with the first part of Hebrew Quest. Hebrew Quest videos are here, and the accompanying Memrise module is here. To say it differently, Hebrew Quest and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest complement one another in a circular (and maybe slightly paradoxical!) form: The more Hebrew Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, and . . . The more Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest you have completed, the more you will get out of Hebrew Quest (especially Hebrew Quest Lessons 13-40) Either way, you can’t go wrong! The most important thing is to start and ultimately complete both. Again, the Hebrew Quest study passage track within Hebrew Grammar Quest will get you on your way to this lofty goal of completing both courses. Refer to the section on Anki and course setup to get your Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest outfitted properly. "],["whocanuse.html", "What can I do with the knowledge taught in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest?", " What can I do with the knowledge taught in Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest? We believe this course, in conjunction with Hebrew Quest, would prepare a pastor or lay-teacher of a small-group, or traditional Christian or Messianic congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text in order to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience. Even so, we are not presenting this as a substitute for seminary-level Hebrew for those who are seeking (or whose vocational position requires) more of a formal instructional approach. With all this said, the more of THIS course and Hebrew Quest you complete, the more rewarding and enriching any future formal Hebrew coursework will be!.

Workbook/Parsing Brief Hebrew word activities to reinforce the grammar concepts. In Unit 3, the focus shifts to what is called “parsing” of verbs. Verb parsing means identifying the root, stem, person, gender, number, and meaning of a verb. D. Study Verses You will begin to translate from Hebrew to English.
