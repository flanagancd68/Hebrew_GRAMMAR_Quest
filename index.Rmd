# Preview Version {#preface .unnumbered}

Welcome to the preview version of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest. Here, we are offering the first three lessons. The complete version, expected in late Spring 2021, will have thirty-five lessons.

We have two purposes for this preview:

1.  Gather feedback on content and overall direction from Holy Language Volunteers before compiling all thirty-five lessons<small>[^index-1]</small>.
2.  Eventually, these three lessons will comprise a demo/trial version of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest made available to the general public.

[^index-1]: <small>Specifically, we seek your help us with proofing the style and content of this guidebook (typos and readability) and reviewing the Anki deck.</small>
