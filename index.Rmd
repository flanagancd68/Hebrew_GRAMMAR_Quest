# This is a Preview/Demo Version of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest {-}

In addition to the introduction, which describes the philosophy and structure of the course, we will cover the first three lessons:

1. The Hebrew Aleph-Bet
2. The Hebrew Vowels
3. Hebrew Syllabification and Pronunciation


We have two goals for this version:

1. Create a "proof of concept" version for our Holy Language ministry volunteers.  We want to gather feedback on content and overall direction before compiling all 35 lessons.
2. Eventually, these three lessons will comprise a demo/trial version of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest made available to the general public. 

The anticipated full course availability date, with all thirty-five lessons is June 2021.

Thank you in advance for your review.  After Lesson 3, there will be a brief [survey](https://forms.gle/GZac85rd4FHQt8KeA){target="_blank"} to get your feedback.  Also please do not hesitate to email errors, omissions, comments, or suggestions to holylanguagecourses@gmail.com (in fact we'd rather hear about mistakes sooner rather than later!)
