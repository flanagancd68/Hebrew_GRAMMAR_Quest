# Preface {- #preface}

Welcome to the preview version of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest.  Here, we are offering the first three lessons. The complete version, expected in late Spring 2021, will have thirty-five lessons.

We have two purposes for this preview:

1. Gather feedback on content and overall direction from Holy Language Volunteers before compiling all thirty-five lessons.
2. Eventually, these three lessons will comprise a demo/trial version of Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest made available to the general public. 

Please do not hesitate to email errors, omissions, comments, or suggestions to holylanguagecourses@gmail.com (in fact we'd rather hear about mistakes sooner rather than later!)
