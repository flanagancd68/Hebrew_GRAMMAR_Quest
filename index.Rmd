Welcome to Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest, from Holy Language Institute. 

The journey into the world of Biblical Hebrew grammar is a peek inside the mind of HaShem. By increased understanding of the Bible, we can better experience part of the culture of Bible authors such as Moses, David, and the prophets.  With some narratives, reading them in Hebrew almost places us right there in the middle of the action.  That's pretty cool!

Most importantly, learning the original language draws us closer to Yeshua and the world to which He ministered.  

It is for these reasons that we like to say this is not just a course, but a __QUEST__.  Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is a journey into a deeper love your Bible and its primary Author.

On the next few pages, we will tell you a little about our program and give you some preliminary action steps so you can get your gear in order before you begin your quest with Lesson 1.

Let's get started!

As we begin,  we wanted to let you know our purposes for our course, and what, we believe, makes our course distinct from the many other Hebrew learning options available.

Our Holy Language goals for a Hebrew grammar course are the following:

* Academically CHALLENGING, but with a LOW-STRESS level
* Primary emphasis on READING and UNDERSTANDING God's Word
    * We approach learning Hebrew from a _devotional_ level, more than an academic one
    * We use grammar rules, paradigms, and memorization as a means to achieve this goal
    * The "final exam" should be whether you can understand the Bible, not whether you can conjugate a a particular Hebrew verb
    * We do not prioritize writing or speaking in Hebrew, and we are not addressing Modern Hebrew^[We believe this course, in conjunction with **Hebrew Quest**, would prepare a pastor or lay-teacher of a small-group, or traditional Christian or Messianic congregation to have a basic understanding of the Hebrew text in order to exegete and communicate beginning and intermediate level Hebrew/Hebraic concepts to a lay audience.  Even so, we are not presenting this as a substitute for seminary-level Hebrew for those who are seeking (or whose vocational position requires) more of a formal instructional approach. With all this said, the more of THIS course and _Hebrew Quest_ you complete, the more rewarding THAT course will be!. In any case, ***our prayer is that this course, along with Hebrew Quest, will give new life to Hebrew application in that person's teaching ministry***.  This book's compiler can testify to this!]
* Self-paced for independent learning but with mechanisms to provide FEEDBACK, ENCOURAGEMENT, and ways to CELEBRATE Students' ACCOMPLISHMENTS in the course
* Aligns with our [Holy Language LEARNING PHILOSOPHY](https://holylanguage.com/learning-philosophy.php): emphasize active forms of learning over copious amounts of textbook reading and long lectures
    * This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the material, but only about 20% of learning (if that) comes from a passive activity such as reading.  This is why we have added audio narration to help with retention.
    * The activities such as Anki, is truly where you will LEARN the material - note the root word ACTIVE in the word "activities"
* COMPLIMENTS and INTEGRATES WITH _Hebrew Quest_, but does not replace it; **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is not a substitute for completing _Hebrew Quest_**
    * If you took a microscope to _Hebrew Quest_ lessons 13-15, Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest is the result!
    * See the Appendix FAQs for additional discussion on how _Hebrew Quest_ and Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest relate to one another
* SUSTAINABLE from a technical standpoint, meaning the course is inexpensive and straightforward for the ministry to develop, deliver, and maintain
* FREE of charge for our students
* Most importantly, the course must be YESHUA-CENTERED that approaches learning Hebrew grammar as a spiritual as well as an academic endeavor (which is also a big part of our Learning Philosophy)

We are essentially trying to take the best attributes of a self-paced course and merge them with the best characteristics of a seminary-level Hebrew course, all in a way that reflects the heart of the Holy Language Institute!  We believe that result is Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest!

## The Fog {-}

The "Fog" is a term coined by Dr. Bill Mounce, author of _Basics of Biblical Greek_.  "Fog" describes the feeling that you aren't making any progress in learning a Biblical language when you actually are making TREMENDOUS progress!


Mounce states, "The fog means you will have read a chapter and think you understand it—and perhaps you do—but it will seem foggy. That’s okay. If living in the fog becomes discouraging, look two chapters back and you should understand that chapter clearly. In two more chapters the presently foggy chapter will be clear, assuming you keep studying."

Here is an article on the subject you may find encouraging: [Conquering the Fog](./images/00_Fog_Article.pdf){target="_blank"}.  

::: {.box .light}
Keep pressing on!

* Review a chapter, do the activities, then try the `Anki` flashcard work
* If `Anki` is proving difficult, go back and review the chapter, or perhaps view the full-length Lecture or complete the additional worksheets provided by Dr. Beckman.  You can find a link to these in `Lesson Extras`
